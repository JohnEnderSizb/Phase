<div class="story_text" id="1"><p>I suppose you know all about the stage and stage people.  You've  been touched with and by actors, and you read the newspaper  criticisms and the jokes in the weeklies about the Rialto and the  chorus girls and the long-haired tragedians.  And I suppose that a  condensed list of your ideas about the mysterious stageland would  boil down to something like this: </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Leading ladies have five husbands, paste diamonds, and figures no  better than your own (madam) if they weren't padded.  Chorus  girls are inseparable from peroxide, Panhards and Pittsburg.  All  shows walk back to New York on tan oxford and railroad ties.   Irreproachable actresses reserve the comic-landlady part for their  mothers on Broadway and their step-aunts on the road.  Kyrle  Bellew's real name is Boyle O'Kelley.  The ravings of John  McCullough in the phonograph were stolen from the first sale of  the Ellen Terry memoirs.  Joe Weber is funnier than E. H. Sothern;  but Henry Miller is getting older than he was. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        All theatrical people on leaving the theatre at night drink  champagne and eat lobsters until noon the next day.  After all, the  moving pictures have got the whole bunch pounded to a pulp. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Now, few of us know the real life of the stage people.  If we did,  the profession might be more overcrowded than it is.  We look  askance at the players with an eye full of patronizing superiority -  and we go home and practise all sorts of elocution and gestures in  front of our looking glasses. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Latterly there has been much talk of the actor people in a new  light.  It seems to have been divulged that instead of being  motoring bacchanalias and diamond-hungry <i>loreleis</i> they are  businesslike folk, students and ascetics with children and homes  and libraries, owning real estate, and conducting their private  affairs in as orderly and unsensational a manner as any of us good  citizens who are bound to the chariot wheels of the gas, rent, coal,  ice, and wardmen. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Whether the old or the new report of the sock-and-buskiners be the  true one is a surmise that has no place here.  I offer you merely this  little story of two strollers; and for proof of its truth I can show you  only the dark patch above the cast-iron of the stage-entrance door  of Keetor's old vaudeville theatre made there by the petulant push  of gloved hands too impatient to finger the clumsy thumb-latch -  and where I last saw Cherry whisking through like a swallow into  her nest, on time to the minute, as usual, to dress for her act. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The vaudeville team of Hart & Cherry was an inspiration.  But  Hart had been roaming through the Eastern and Western circuits  for four years with a mixed-up act comprising a monologue, three  lightning changes with songs, a couple of imitations of celebrated  imitators, and a buck-and-wing dance that had drawn a glance of  approval from the bass-viol player in more than one house - than  which no performer ever received more satisfactory evidence of  good work. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The greatest treat an actor can have is to witness the pitiful  performance with which all other actors desecrate the stage.  In  order to give himself this pleausre he will often forsake the  sunniest Broadway corner between Thirty-fourth and Forty-fourth  to attend a matinee offering by his less gifted brothers.  Once  during the lifetime of a minstrel joke one comes to scoff and  remains to go through with that most difficult exercise of Thespian  muscles - the audible contact of the palm of one hand against the  palm of the other. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        One afternoon Bob Hart presented his solvent, serious, well-known  vaudevillian face at the box-office window of a rival attraction and  got his d. h. coupon for an orchestra seat. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        A, B, C, and D glowed successively on the announcement spaces  and passed into oblivion, each plunging Mr. Hart deeper into  gloom.  Others of the audience shrieked, squirmed, whistled, and  applauded; but Bob Hart, "All the Mustard and a Whole Show in  Himself," sat with his face as long and his hands as far apart as a  boy holding a hank of yarn for his grandmother to wind into a ball. </p></div>

			<div class="pagers" id="3"><a href="StriBusi.shtml.html#2"><b>&lt;</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="StriBusi.shtml.html#3">3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="StriBusi.shtml.html#4"><b>&gt;</b></a></div>
			
			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        But when H came on, "The Mustard" suddenly sat up straight.  H  was the happy alphabetical prognosticator of Winona Cherry, in  Character Songs and Impersonations.  There were scarcely more  than two bites to Cherry; but she delivered the merchandise tied  with a pink cord and charged to the old man's account.  She first  showed you a deliciously dewy and ginghamy country girl with a  basket of property daisies who informed you ingenuously that  there were other things to be learned at the old log school-house  besides cipherin' and nouns, especially "When the Teach-er Kept  Me in."  Vanishing, with a quick flirt of gingham apron-strings,  she reappeared in considerably less than a "trice" as a fluffy  "Parisienne" - so near does Art bring the old red mill to the Moulin  Rouge.  And then -  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        But you know the rest.  And so did Bob Hart; but he saw  somebody else.  He thought he saw that Cherry was the only  professional on the short order stage that he had seen who seemed  exactly to fit the part of "Helen Grimes" in the sketch he had  written and kept tucked away in the tray of his trunk.  Of course  Bob Hart, as well as every other normal actor, grocer, newspaper  man, professor, curb broker, and farmer, has a play tucked away  somewhere.  They tuck 'em in trays of trunks, trunks of trees,  desks, haymows, pigeonholes, inside pockets, safe-deposit vaults,  handboxes, and coal cellars, waiting for Mr. Frohman to call.   They belong among the fifty-seven different kinds. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        But Bob Hart's sketch was not destined to end in a pickle jar.  He  called it "Mice Will Play."  He had kept it quiet and hidden away  ever since he wrote it, waiting to find a partner who fitted his  conception of "Helen Grimes."  And here was "Helen" herself,  with all the innocent abandon, the youth, the sprightliness, and the  flawless stage art that his critical taste demanded. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        After the act was over Hart found the manager in the box office,  and got Cherry's address.  At five the next afternoon he called at  the musty old house in the West Forties and sent up his  professional card. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        By daylight, in a secular shirtwaist and plain <i>voile</i> skirt, with  her hair curbed and her Sister of Charity eyes, Winona Cherry  might have been playing the part of Prudence Wise, the deacon's  daughter, in the great (unwritten) New England drama not yet  entitled anything. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I know your act, Mr. Hart," she said after she had looked over his  card carefully.  "What did you wish to see me about?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I saw you work last night," said Hart.  "I've written a sketch that  I've been saving up.  It's for two; and I think you can do the other  part.  I thought I'd see you about it." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Come in the parlor," said Miss Cherry.  "I've been wishing for  something of the sort.  I think I'd like to act instead of doing  turns." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Bob Hart drew his cherished "Mice Will Play" from his pocket,  and read it to her. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Read it again, please," said Miss Cherry. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And then she pointed out to him clearly how it could be improved  by introducing a messenger instead of a telephone call, and cutting  the dialogue just before the climax while they were struggling with  the pistol, and by completely changing the lines and business of  Helen Grimes at the point where her jealousy overcomes her.  Hart  yielded to all her strictures without argument.  She had at once put  her finger on the sketch's weaker points.  That was her woman's  intuition that he had lacked.  At the end of their talk Hart was  willing to stake the judgment, experience, and savings of his four  years of vaudeville that "Mice Will Play" would blossom into a  perennial flower in the garden of the circuits.  Miss Cherry was  slower to decide.  After many puckerings of her smooth young  brow and tappings on her small, white teeth with the end of a lead  pencil she gave out her dictum. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Mr. Hart," said she, "I believe your sketch is going to win out.   That Grimes part fits me like a shrinkable flannel after its first trip  to a handless hand laundry.  I can make it stand out like the  colonel of the Forty-fourth Regiment at a Little Mothers' Bazaar.   And I've seen you work.  I know what you can do with the other  part.  But business is business.  How much do you get a week for  the stunt you do now?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Two hundred," answered Hart. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I get one hundred for mine," said Cherry.  "That's about the  natural discount for a woman.  But I live on it and put a few  simoleons every week under the loose brick in the old kitchen  hearth.  The stage is all right.  I love it; but there's something else I  love better - that's a little country home, some day, with Plymouth  Rock chickens and six ducks wandering around the yard. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Now, let me tell you, Mr. Hart, I am STRICTLY BUSINESS.  If  you want me to play the opposite part in your sketch, I'll do it.   And I believe we can make it go.  And there's something else I  want to say:  There's no nonsense in my make-up; I'm <i>on the  level</i>, and I'm on the stage for what it pays me, just as other girls  work in stores and offices.  I'm going to save my money to keep  me when I'm past doing my stunts.  No Old Ladies' Home or  Retreat for Imprudent Actresses for me. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "If you want to make this a business partnership, Mr. Hart, with all  nonsense cut out of it, I'm in on it.  I know something about  vaudeville teams in general; but this would have to be one in  particular.  I want you to know that I'm on the stage for what I can  cart away from it every pay-day in a little manila envelope with  nicotine stains on it, where the cashier has licked the flap.  It's  kind of a hobby of mine to want to cravenette myself for plenty of  rainy days in the future.  I want you to know just how I am.  I don't  know what an all-night restaurant looks like; I drink only weak  tea; I never spoke to a man at a stage entrance in my life, and I've  got money in five savings banks." </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Miss Cherry," said Bob Hart in his smooth, serious tones, "you're  in on your own terms.  I've got 'strictly business' pasted in my hat  and stenciled on my make-up box.  When I dream of nights I  always see a five-room bungalow on the north shore of Long  Island, with a Jap cooking clam broth and duckling in the kitchen,  and me with the title deeds to the place in my pongee coat pocket,  swinging in a hammock on the side porch, reading Stanleys  'Explorations into Africa.'  And nobody else around.  You never  was interested in Africa, was you, Miss Cherry?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Not any," said Cherry.  "What I'm going to do with my money is  to bank it.  You can get four percent on deposits.  Even at the  salary I've been earning, I've figured out that in ten years I'd have  an income of about $50 a month just from the interest alone.   Well, I might invest some of the principal in a little business - say,  trimming hats or a beauty parlor, and make more." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Well," said Hart, "You've got the proper idea all right, all right,  anyhow.  There are mighty few actors that amount to anything at  all who couldn't fix themselves for the wet days to come if they'd  save their money instead of blowing it.  I'm glad you've got the  correct business idea of it, Miss Cherry.  I think the same way; and  I believe this sketch will more than double what both of us earn  now when we get it shaped up." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The subsequent history of "Mice Will Play" is the history of all  successful writings for the stage.  Hart & Cherry cut it, pieced it,  remodeled it, performed surgical operations on the dialogue and  business, changed the lines, restored 'em, added more, cut 'em out,  renamed it, gave it back the old name, rewrote it, substituted a  dagger for the pistol, restored the pistol - put the sketch through all  the known processes of condensation and improvement. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        They rehearsed it by the old-fashioned boardinghouse clock in the  rarely used parlor until its warning click at five minutes to the hour  would occur every time exactly half a second before the click of  the unloaded revolver that Helen Grimes used in rehearsing the  thrilling climax of the sketch. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Yes, that was a thriller and a piece of excellent work.  In the act a  real 32-caliber revolver was used loaded with a real cartridge.   Helen Grimes, who is a Western girl of decidedly Buffalo Billish  skill and daring, is tempestuously in love with Frank Desmond, the  private secretary and confidential prospective son-in-law of her  father, "Arapahoe" Grimes, quarter-million-dollar cattle king,  owning a ranch that, judging by the scenery, is in either the Bad  Lands or Amagensett, L. I.  Desmond (in private life Mr. Bob  Hart) wears puttees and Meadow Brook Hunt riding trousers, and  gives his address as New York, leaving you to wonder why he  comes to the Bad Lands or Amagansett (as the case may be) and at  the same time to conjecture mildly why a cattleman should want  puttees about his ranch with a secretary in 'em. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Well, anyhow, you know as well as I do that we all like that kind  of play, whether we admit it or not - something along in between  "Bluebeard, Jr.," and "Cymbeline" played in the Russian. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        There were only two parts and a half in "Mice Will Play."  Hart  and Cherry were the two, of course; and the half was a minor part  always played by a stage hand, who merely came in once in a  Tuxedo coat and a panic to announce that the house was  surrounded by Indians, and to turn down the gas fire in the grate  by the manager's orders. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        There was another girl in the sketch - a Fifth Avenue society  swelless - who was visiting the ranch and who had sirened Jack  Valentine when he was a wealthy club-man on lower Third  Avenue before he lost his money.  This girl appeared on the stage  only in the photographic state - Jack had her Sarony stuck up on  the mantel of the Amagan - of the Bad Lands droring room.  Helen  was jealous, of course. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And now for the thriller.  Old "Arapahoe" Grimes dies of angina  pectoris one night - so Helen informs us in a stage-ferryboat  whisper over the footlights - while only his secretary was present.   And that same day he was known to have had $647,000 in cash in  his (ranch) library just received for the sale of a drove of beeves in  the East (that accounts for the price we pay for steak!).  The cash  disappears at the same time.  Jack Valentine was the only person  with the ranchman when he made his (alleged) croak. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Gawd knows I love him; but if he has done this deed -" you sabe,  don't you?  And then there are some mean things said about the  Fifth Avenue Girl - who doesn't come on the stage - and can we  blame her, with the vaudeville trust holding down prices until one  actually must be buttoned in the back by a call boy, maids cost so  much? </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        But, wait.  Here's the climax.  Helen Grimes, chaparralish as she  can be, is goaded beyond imprudence.  She convinces herself that  Jack Valentine is not only a falsetto, but a financier.  To lose at  one fell swoop $647,000 and a lover in riding trousers with angles  in the sides like the variations on the chart of a typhoid-fever  patient is enough to make any perfect lady mad.  So, then! </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        They stand in the (ranch) library, which is furnished with mounted  elk heads (didn't the Elks have a fish fry in Amagensett once?),  and the d'enouement begins.  I know of no more interesting time in  the run of a play unless it be when the prologue ends. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Helen thinks Jack has taken the money.  Who else was there to  take it?  The box-office manager was at the front on his job; the  orchestra hadn't left their seats; and no man could get past "Old  Jimmy," the stage door-man, unless he could show a Skye terrier  or an automobile as a guarantee of eligibility. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Goaded beyond imprudence (as before said), Helen says to Jack  Valentine:  "Robber and thief - and worse yet, stealer of trusting  hearts, this should be your fate!" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        With that out she whips, of course, the trusty 32-caliber. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "But I will be merciful," goes on Helen.  "You shall live - that will  be your punishment.  I will show you how easily I could have sent  you to the death that you deserve.  There is <i>her</i> picture on the  mantel.  I will send through her more beautiful face the bullet that  should have pierced your craven heart." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And she does it.  And there's no fake blank cartridges or assistants  pulling strings.  Helen fires.  The bullet - the actual bullet - goes  through the face of the photograph - and then strikes the hidden  spring of the sliding panel in the wall - and lo! the panel slides, and  there is the missing $647,000 in convincing stacks of currency and  bags of gold.  It's great.  You know how it is.  Cherry practised for  two months at a target on the roof of her boarding house.  It took  good shooting.  In the sketch she had to hit a brass disk only three  inches in diameter, covered by wall paper in the panel; and she  had to stand in exactly the same spot every night, and the photo  had to be in exactly the same spot, and she had to shoot steady and  true every time. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Of course old "Arapahoe" had tucked the funds away there in the  secret place; and, of course, Jack hadn't taken anything except his  salary (which really might have come under the head of "obtaining  money under"; but that is neither here nor there); and, of course,  the New York girl was really engaged to a concrete house  contractor in the Bronx; and, necessarily, Jack and Helen ended in  a half-Nelson - and there you are. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        After Hart and Cherry had gotten "Mice Will Play" flawless, they  had a try-out at a vaudeville house that accommodates.  The sketch  was a house wrecker.  It was one of those rare strokes of talent that  inundates a theatre from the roof down.  The gallery wept; and the  orchestra seats, being dressed for it, swam in tears. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        After the show the booking agents signed blank checks and  pressed fountain pens upon Hart and Cherry.  Five hundred dollars  a week was what it panned out. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        That night at 11:30 Bob Hart took off his hat and bade Cherry  good night at her boarding-house door. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Mr. Hart," said she thoughtfully, "come inside just a few minutes.   We've got our chance now to make good and make money.  What  we want to do is to cut expenses every cent we can, and save all  we can." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Right," said Bob.  "It's business with me.  You've got your  scheme for banking yours; and I dream every night of that  bungalow with the Jap cook and nobody around to raise trouble.   Anything to enlarge the net receipts will engage my attention." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Come inside just a few minutes," repeated Cherry, deeply  thoughtful.  "I've got a proposition to make to you that will reduce  our expenses a lot and help you work out your own future and help  me work out mine - and all on business principles." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Mice Will Play" had a tremendously successful run in New York  for ten weeks - rather neat for a vaudeville sketch - and then it  started on the circuits.  Without following it, it may be said that it  was a solid drawing card for two years without a sign of abated  popularity. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Sam Packard, manager of one of Keetor's New York houses, said  of Hart & Cherry: </p></div>

			<div class="pagers" id="11"><a href="StriBusi.shtml.html#10"><b>&lt;</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="StriBusi.shtml.html#11">11</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="StriBusi.shtml.html#12"><b>&gt;</b></a></div>
			
			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "As square and high-toned a little team as ever came over the  circuit.  It's a pleasure to read their names on the booking list.   Quiet, hard workers, no Johnny and Mabel nonsense, on the job to  the minute, straight home after their act, and each of 'em as  gentlemanlike as a lady.  I don't expect to handle any attractions  that give me less trouble or more respect for the profession." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And now, after so much cracking of a nutshell, here is the kernel  of the story: </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        At the end of its second season "Mice Will Play" came back to  New York for another run at the roof gardens and summer  theatres.  There was never any trouble in booking it at the top-notch price.  Bob Hart had his bungalow nearly paid for, and  Cherry had so many savings-deposit bank books that she had  begun to buy sectional bookcases on the instalment plan to hold  them. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I tell you these things to assure you, even if you can't believe it,  that many, very many of the stage people are workers with abiding  ambitions - just the same as the man who wants to be president, or  the grocery clerk who wants a home in Flatbush, or a lady who is  anxious to flop out of the Count-pan into the Prince-fire.  And I  hope I may be allowed to say, without chipping into the  contribution basket, that they often move in a mysterious way their  wonders to perform. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        But, listen. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        At the first performance of "Mice Will Play" in New York at the  Westphalia (no hams alluded to) Theatre, Winona Cherry was  nervous.  When she fired at the photograph of the Eastern beauty  on the mantel, the bullet, instead of penetrating the photo and then  striking the disk, went into the lower left side of Bob Hart's neck.   Not expecting to get it there, Hart collapsed neatly, while Cherry  fainted in a most artistic manner. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The audience, surmising that they viewed a comedy instead of a  tragedy in which the principals were married or reconciled,  applauded with great enjoyment.  The Cool Head, who always  graces such occasions, rang the curtain down, and two platoons of  scene shifters respectively and more or less respectfully removed  Hart & Cherry from the stage.  The next turn went on, and all went  as merry as an alimony bell. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The stage hands found a young doctor at the stage entrance who  was waiting for a patient with a decoction of Am. B'ty roses.  The  doctor examined Hart carefully and laughed heartily. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "No headlines for you, Old Sport," was his diagnosis.  "If it had  been two inches to the left it would have undermined the carotid  artery as far as the Red Front Drug Store in Flatbush and Back  Again.  As it is, you just get the property man to bind it up with a  flounce torn from any one of the girls' Valenciennes and go home  and get it dressed by the parlor-floor practitioner on your block,  and you'll be all right.  Excuse me; I've got a serious case outside  to look after." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        After that, Bob Hart looked up and felt better.  And then to where  he lay came Vincente, the Tramp Juggler, great in his line.   Vincente, a solemn man from Brattleboro, Vt., named Sam Griggs  at home, sent toys and maple sugar home to two small daughters  from every town he played.  Vincente had moved on the same  circuits with Hart & Cherry, and was their peripatetic friend. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Bob," said Vincente in his serious way, "I'm glad it's no worse.   The little lady is wild about you." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Who?" asked Hart. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Cherry," said the juggler.  "We didn't know how bad you were  hurt; and we kept her away.  It's taking the manager and three girls  to hold her." </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "It was an accident, of course," said Hart.  "Cherry's all right.  She  wasn't feeling in good trim or she couldn't have done it.  There's no  hard feelings.  She's strictly business.  The doctor says I'll be on  the job again in three days.  Don't let her worry." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Man," said Sam Griggs severely, puckering his old, smooth, lined  face, "are you a chess automaton or a human pincushion?  Cherry's  crying her heart out for you - calling 'Bob, Bob,' every second, with  them holding her hands and keeping her from coming to you." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "What's the matter with her?" asked Hart, with wide-open eyes.   "The sketch'll go on again in three days.  I'm not hurt bad, the  doctor says.  She won't lose out half a week's salary.  I know it was  an accident.  What's the matter with her?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "You seem to be blind, or a sort of a fool," said Vincente.  "The  girl loves you and is almost mad about your hurt.  What's the  matter with <i>you</i>?  Is she nothing to you?  I wish you could hear  her call you." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Loves me?" asked Bob Hart, rising from the stack of scenery on  which he lay.  "Cherry loves me?  Why, it's impossible." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I wish you could see her and hear her," said Griggs. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "But, man," said Bob Hart, sitting up, "it's impossible.  It's  impossible, I tell you.  I never dreamed of such a thing." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "No human being," said the Tramp Juggler, "could mistake it.   She's wild for love of you.  How have you been so blind?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "But, my God," said Bob Hart, rising to his feet, "it's <i>too late</i>.   It's too late, I tell you, Sam; <i>it's too late</i>.  It can't be.  You must  be wrong.  It's <i>impossible</i>.  There's some mistake. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "She's crying for you," said the Tramp Juggler.  "For love of you  she's fighting three, and calling your name so loud they don't dare  to raise the curtain.  Wake up, man." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "For love of me?" said Bob Hart with staring eyes.  "Don't I tell  you it's too late?  It's too late, man.  Why, <i>Cherry and I have been  married two years!</i>"</div>
