<div class="story_text" id="1"><p>On the rack in the railway carriage immediately opposite Clovis was a solidly  wrought travelling bag, with a carefully written label, on which was inscribed,  "J. P. Huddle, The Warren, Tilfield, near Slowborough." Immediately below the  rack sat the human embodiment of the label, a solid, sedate individual, sedately  dressed, sedately conversational. Even without his conversation (which was  addressed to a friend seated by his side, and touched chiefly on such topics as  the backwardness of Roman hyacinths and the prevalence of measles at the  Rectory), one could have gauged fairly accurately the temperament and mental  outlook of the travelling bag's owner. But he seemed unwilling to leave anything  to the imagination of a casual observer, and his talk grew presently personal  and introspective. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I don't know how it is," he told his friend, "I'm not much over forty,  but I seem to have settled down into a deep groove of elderly middle-age. My  sister shows the same tendency. We like everything to be exactly in its  accustomed place; we like things to happen exactly at their appointed times; we  like everything to be usual, orderly, punctual, methodical, to a hair's breadth,  to a minute. It distresses and upsets us if it is not so. For instance, to take  a very trifling matter, a thrush has built its nest year after year in the  catkin-tree on the lawn; this year, for no obvious reason, it is building in the  ivy on the garden wall. We have said very little about it, but I think we both  feel that the change is unnecessary, and just a little irritating." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Perhaps," said the friend, "it is a different thrush." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "We have suspected that," said J. P. Huddle, "and I think it gives us even  more cause for annoyance. We don't feel that we want a change of thrush at our  time of life; and yet, as I have said, we have scarcely reached an age when  these things should make themselves seriously felt." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "What you want," said the friend, "is an Unrest-cure." </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "An Unrest-cure? I've never heard of such a thing." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "You've heard of Rest-cures for people who've broken down under stress of  too much worry and strenuous living; well, you're suffering from overmuch repose  and placidity, and you need the opposite kind of treatment." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "But where would one go for such a thing?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Well, you might stand as an Orange candidate for Kilkenny, or do a course  of district visiting in one of the Apache quarters of Paris, or give lectures in  Berlin to prove that most of Wagner's music was written by Gambetta; and there's  always the interior of Morocco to travel in. But, to be really effective, the  Unrest-cure ought to be tried in the home. How you would do it I haven't the  faintest idea." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        It was at this point in the conversation that Clovis became galvanized into  alert attention. After all, his two days' visit to an elderly relative at  Slowborough did not promise much excitement. Before the train had stopped he had  decorated his sinister shirt-cuff with the inscription, "J. P. Huddle, The  Warren, Tilfield, near Slowborough." </p><p class='section_break'>*</p><p>Two mornings later Mr. Huddle broke in on his sister's privacy as she sat  reading Country Life in the morning room. It was her day and hour and place for  reading Country Life, and the intrusion was absolutely irregular; but he bore in  his hand a telegram, and in that household telegrams were recognized as  happening by the hand of God. This particular telegram partook of the nature of  a thunderbolt. "Bishop examining confirmation class in neighbourhood unable  stay rectory on account measles invokes your hospitality sending secretary  arrange." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I scarcely know the Bishop; I've only spoken to him once," exclaimed J. P.  Huddle, with the exculpating air of one who realizes too late the indiscretion  of speaking to strange Bishops. Miss Huddle was the first to rally; she disliked  thunderbolts as fervently as her brother did, but the womanly instinct in her  told her that thunderbolts must be fed. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "We can curry the cold duck," she said. It was not the appointed day for  curry, but the little orange envelope involved a certain departure from rule and  custom. Her brother said nothing, but his eyes thanked her for being brave. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "A young gentleman to see you," announced the parlour-maid. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The secretary!" murmured the Huddles in unison; they instantly stiffened  into a demeanour which proclaimed that, though they held all strangers to be  guilty, they were willing to hear anything they might have to say in their  defence. The young gentleman, who came into the room with a certain elegant  haughtiness, was not at all Huddle's idea of a bishop's secretary; he had not  supposed that the episcopal establishment could have afforded such an  expensively upholstered article when there were so many other claims on its  resources. The face was fleetingly familiar; if he had bestowed more attention  on the fellow-traveller sitting opposite him in the railway carriage two days  before he might have recognized Clovis in his present visitor. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "You are the Bishop's secretary?" asked Huddle, becoming consciously  deferential. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "His confidential secretary," answered Clovis. "You may call me  Stanislaus; my other name doesn't matter. The Bishop and Colonel Alberti may be  here to lunch. I shall be here in any case." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        It sounded rather like the programme of a Royal visit. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The Bishop is examining a confirmation class in the neighbourhood, isn't  he?" asked Miss Huddle. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Ostensibly," was the dark reply, followed by a request for a large-scale  map of the locality. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Clovis was still immersed in a seemingly profound study of the map when  another telegram arrived. It was addressed to "Prince Stanislaus, care of  Huddle, The Warren, etc." Clovis glanced at the contents and announced: "The  Bishop and Alberti won't be here till late in the afternoon." Then he returned  to his scrutiny of the map. </p></div>

			<div class="pagers" id="4"><a href="UnrCur.shtml.html#3"><b>&lt;</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="UnrCur.shtml.html#4">4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="UnrCur.shtml.html#5"><b>&gt;</b></a></div>
			
			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The luncheon was not a very festive function. The princely secretary ate and  drank with fair appetite, but severely discouraged conversation. At the finish  of the meal he broke suddenly into a radiant smile, thanked his hostess for a  charming repast, and kissed her hand with deferential rapture. Miss Huddle was  unable to decide in her mind whether the action savoured of Louis Quatorzian  courtliness or the reprehensible Roman attitude towards the Sabine women. It was  not her day for having a headache, but she felt that the circumstances excused  her, and retired to her room to have as much headache as was possible before the  Bishop's arrival. Clovis, having asked the way to the nearest telegraph office,  disappeared presently down the carriage drive. Mr. Huddle met him in the hall  some two hours later, and asked when the Bishop would arrive. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "He is in the library with Alberti," was the reply. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "But why wasn't I told? I never knew he had come!" exclaimed Huddle. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "No one knows he is here," said Clovis; "the quieter we can keep matters  the better. And on no account disturb him in the library. Those are his  orders." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "But what is all this mystery about? And who is Alberti? And isn't the  Bishop going to have tea?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The Bishop is out for blood, not tea." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Blood!" gasped Huddle, who did not find that the thunderbolt improved on  acquaintance. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Tonight is going to be a great night in the history of Christendom," said  Clovis. "We are going to massacre every Jew in the neighbourhood." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "To massacre the Jews!" said Huddle indignantly. "Do you mean to tell me  there's a general rising against them?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "No, it's the Bishop's own idea. He's in there arranging all the details  now." </p></div>

			<div class="pagers" id="5"><a href="UnrCur.shtml.html#4"><b>&lt;</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="UnrCur.shtml.html#5">5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="UnrCur.shtml.html#6"><b>&gt;</b></a></div>
			
			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "But - the Bishop is such a tolerant, humane man." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "That is precisely what will heighten the effect of his action. The  sensation will be enormous." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        That at least Huddle could believe. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "He will be hanged!" he exclaimed with conviction. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "A motor is waiting to carry him to the coast, where a steam yacht is in  readiness." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "But there aren't thirty Jews in the whole neighbourhood," protested  Huddle, whose brain, under the repeated shocks of the day, was operating with  the uncertainty of a telegraph wire during earthquake disturbances. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "We have twenty-six on our list," said Clovis, referring to a bundle of  notes. "We shall be able to deal with them all the more thoroughly." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Do you mean to tell me that you are meditating violence against a man like  Sir Leon Birberry," stammered Huddle; "he's one of the most respected men in  the country." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "He's down on our list," said Clovis carelessly; "after all, we've got men  we can trust to do our job, so we shan't have to rely on local assistance. And  we've got some Boy-scouts helping us as auxiliaries." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Boy-scouts!" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Yes; when they understood there was real killing to be done they were even  keener than the men." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "This thing will be a blot on the Twentieth Century!" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "And your house will be the blotting-pad. Have you realized that half the  papers of Europe and the United States will publish pictures of it? By the way,  I've sent some photographs of you and your sister, that I found in the library,  to the <I>Matin</I> and <I>Die Woche</I>; I hope you don't mind. Also a sketch  of the staircase; most of the killing will probably be done on the staircase." </p></div>

			<div class="pagers" id="6"><a href="UnrCur.shtml.html#5"><b>&lt;</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="UnrCur.shtml.html#6">6</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="UnrCur.shtml.html#7"><b>&gt;</b></a></div>
			
			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The emotions that were surging in J. P. Huddle's brain were almost too  intense to be disclosed in speech, but he managed to gasp out: "There aren't  any Jews in this house." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Not at present," said Clovis. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I shall go to the police," shouted Huddle with sudden energy. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "In the shrubbery," said Clovis, "are posted ten men, who have orders to  fire on any one who leaves the house without my signal of permission. Another  armed picquet is in ambush near the front gate. The Boy-scouts watch the back  premises." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        At this moment the cheerful hoot of a motor-horn was heard from the drive.  Huddle rushed to the hall door with the feeling of a man half-awakened from a  nightmare, and beheld Sir Leon Birberry, who had driven himself over in his car.  "I got your telegram," he said; "what's up?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Telegram? It seemed to be a day of telegrams. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Come here at once. Urgent. James Huddle," was the purport of the message  displayed before Huddle's bewildered eyes. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I see it all!" he exclaimed suddenly in a voice shaken with agitation, and  with a look of agony in the direction of the shrubbery he hauled the astonished  Birberry into the house. Tea had just been laid in the hall, but the now  thoroughly panic-stricken Huddle dragged his protesting guest upstairs, and in a  few minutes' time the entire household had been summoned to that region of  momentary safety. Clovis alone graced the tea-table with his presence; the  fanatics in the library were evidently too immersed in their monstrous  machinations to dally with the solace of teacup and hot toast. Once the youth  rose, in answer to the summons of the front-door bell, and admitted Mr. Paul  Isaacs, shoemaker and parish councillor, who had also received a pressing  invitation to The Warren. With an atrocious assumption of courtesy, which a  Borgia could hardly have outdone, the secretary escorted this new captive of his  net to the head of the stairway, where his involuntary host awaited him. </p></div>

			<div class="pagers" id="7"><a href="UnrCur.shtml.html#6"><b>&lt;</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="UnrCur.shtml.html#7">7</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="UnrCur.shtml.html#8"><b>&gt;</b></a></div>
			
			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And then ensued a long ghastly vigil of watching and waiting. Once or twice  Clovis left the house to stroll across to the shrubbery, returning always to the  library, for the purpose evidently of making a brief report. Once he took in the  letters from the evening postman, and brought them to the top of the stairs with  punctilious politeness. After his next absence he came half-way up the stairs to  make an announcement. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The Boy-scouts mistook my signal, and have killed the postman. I've had  very little practice in this sort of thing, you see. Another time I shall do  better." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The housemaid, who was engaged to be married to the evening postman, gave way  to clamorous grief. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Remember that your mistress has a headache," said J. P. Huddle. (Miss  Huddle's headache was worse.) </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Clovis hastened downstairs, and after a short visit to the library returned  with another message: </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The Bishop is sorry to hear that Miss Huddle has a headache. He is issuing  orders that as far as possible no firearms shall be used near the house; any  killing that is necessary on the premises will be done with cold steel. The  Bishop does not see why a man should not be a gentleman as well as a  Christian." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        That was the last they saw of Clovis; it was nearly seven o'clock, and his  elderly relative liked him to dress for dinner. But, though he had left them for  ever, the lurking suggestion of his presence haunted the lower regions of the  house during the long hours of the wakeful night, and every creak of the  stairway, every rustle of wind through the shrubbery, was fraught with horrible  meaning. At about seven next morning the gardener's boy and the early postman  finally convinced the watchers that the Twentieth Century was still unblotted. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I don't suppose," mused Clovis, as an early train bore him townwards,  "that they will be in the least grateful for the Unrest-cure."</div>
