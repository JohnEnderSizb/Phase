			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "How many skulls are there altogether?" I inquired.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "They found thirty-eight skulls; there are thirty-nine noted     in the list. They lie piled up in the gravel pit on the edge of     Le Bihan's wheat field. The men are at work yet. Le Bihan is     going to stop them."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Let's go over," said I; and I picked up my gun and started     across the cliffs, Portin on one side, M&ocirc;me on the     other.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Who has the list?" I asked, <a href="http://www.ganiserhatli.com" style="text-decoration:none;cursor:default">lighting</a> my pipe. "You say     there is a list?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The list was found rolled up in a brass cylinder," said the     chemist. He added: "You should not smoke here. You know that if     a single spark drifted into the wheat&mdash;"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Ah, but I have a cover to my pipe," said I, smiling.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Fortin watched me as I closed the pepper-box arrangement     over the glowing bowl of the pipe. Then he continued:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The list was made out on thick yellow paper; the brass tube     has preserved it. It is as fresh to-day as it was in 1760. You     shall see it."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Is that the date?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The list is dated 'April, 1760.' The Brigadier Durand has     it. It is not written in French."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Not written in French!" I exclaimed.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "No," replied Fortin solemnly, "it is written in     Breton."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "But," I protested, "the Breton language was never written     or printed in 1760."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Except by priests," said the chemist.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I have heard of but one priest who ever wrote the Breton     language," I began.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Fortin stole a glance at my face.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "You mean&mdash;the Black Priest?" he asked.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I nodded.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Fortin opened his mouth to speak again, hesitated, and     finally shut his teeth obstinately over the wheat stem that he     was chewing.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "And the Black Priest?" I suggested encouragingly. But I     knew it was useless; for it is easier to move the stars from     their courses than to make an obstinate Breton talk. We walked     on for a minute or two in silence.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Where is the Brigadier Durand?" I asked, motioning     M&ocirc;me to come out of the wheat, which he was trampling as     though it were heather. As I spoke we came in sight of the     farther edge of the wheat field and the dark, wet mass of     cliffs beyond.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Durand is down there&mdash;you can see him; he stands just     behind the mayor of St. Gildas."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I see," said I; and we struck straight down, following a     sun-baked cattle path across the heather.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        When we reached the edge of the wheat field, Le Bihan, the     mayor of St. Gildas, called to me, and I tucked my gun under my     arm and skirted the wheat to where he stood.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Thirty-eight skulls," he said in his thin, high-pitched     voice; "there is but one more, and I am opposed to further     search. I suppose Fortin told you?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I shook hands with him, and returned the salute of the     Brigadier Durand.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I am opposed to further search," repeated Le Bihan,     nervously picking at the mass of silver buttons which covered     the front of his velvet and broadcloth jacket like a     breastplate of scale armor.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Durand pursed up his lips, twisted his tremendous mustache,     and hooked his thumbs in his saber belt.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "As for me," he said, "I am in favor of further search."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Further search for what&mdash;for the thirty-ninth skull?"     I asked.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Le Bihan nodded. Durand frowned at the sunlit sea, rocking     like a bowl of molten gold from the cliffs to the horizon. I     followed his eyes. On the dark glistening cliffs, silhouetted     against the glare of the sea, sat a cormorant, black,     motionless, its horrible head raised toward heaven.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Where is that list, Durand?" I asked.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The gendarme rummaged in his despatch pouch and produced a     brass cylinder about a foot long. Very gravely he unscrewed the     head and dumped out a scroll of thick yellow paper closely     covered with writing on both sides. At a nod from Le Bihan he     handed me the scroll. But I could make nothing of the coarse     writing, now faded to a dull brown.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Come, come, Le Bihan," I said impatiently, "translate it,     won't you? You and Max Fortin make a lot of mystery out of     nothing, it seems."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Le Bihan went to the edge of the pit where the three     Bannalec men were digging, gave an order or two in Breton, and     turned to me.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        As I came to the edge of the pit the Bannalec men were     removing a square piece of sailcloth from what appeared to be a     pile of cobblestones.</p></div>

			<div class="pagers" id="5"><a href="Mess839.shtml.html#4"><b>&lt;</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="Mess839.shtml.html#5">5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="Mess839.shtml.html#6"><b>&gt;</b></a></div>
			
			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Look!" said Le Bihan shrilly. I looked. The pile below was     a heap of skulls. After a moment I clambered down the gravel     sides of the pit and walked over to the men of Bannalec. They     saluted me gravely, leaning on their picks and shovels, and     wiping their sweating faces with sunburned hands.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "How many?" said I in Breton.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Thirty-eight," they replied.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I glanced around. Beyond the heap of skulls lay two piles of     human bones. Beside these was a mound of broken, rusted bits of     iron and steel. Looking closer, I saw that this mound was     composed of rusty bayonets, saber blades, scythe blades, with     here and there a tarnished buckle attached to a bit of leather     hard as iron.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I picked up a couple of buttons and a belt plate. The     buttons bore the royal arms of England; the belt plate was     emblazoned with the English arms and also with the number     "27."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I have heard my grandfather speak of the terrible English     regiment, the 27th Foot, which landed and stormed the fort up     there," said one of the Bannalec men.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Oh!" said I; "then these are the bones of English     soldiers?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Yes," said the men of Bannalec.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Le Bihan was calling to me from the edge of the pit above,     and I handed the belt plate and buttons to the men and climbed     the side of the excavation.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Well," said I, trying to prevent M&ocirc;me from leaping up     and licking my face as I emerged from the pit, "I suppose you     know what these bones are. What are you going to do with     them?"</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "There was a man," said Le Bihan angrily, "an Englishman,     who passed here in a dog-cart on his way to Quimper about an     hour ago, and what do you suppose he wished to do?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Buy the relics?" I asked, smiling.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Exactly&mdash;the pig!" piped the mayor of St. Gildas.     "Jean Marie Tregunc, who found the bones, was standing there     where Max Fortin stands, and do you know what he answered? He     spat upon the ground, and said: 'Pig of an Englishman, do you     take me for a desecrator of graves?'"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I knew Tregunc, a sober, blue-eyed Breton, who lived from     one year's end to the other without being able to afford a     single bit of meat for a meal.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "How much did the Englishman offer Tregunc?" I asked.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Two hundred francs for the skulls alone."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I thought of the relic hunters and the relic buyers on the     battlefields of our civil war.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Seventeen hundred and sixty is long ago," I said.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Respect for the dead can never die," said Fortin.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "And the English soldiers came here to kill your fathers and     burn your homes," I continued.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "They were murderers and thieves, but&mdash;they are dead,"     said Tregunc, coming up from the beach below, his long sea rake     balanced on his dripping jersey.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "How much do you earn every year, Jean Marie?" I asked,     turning to shake hands with him.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Two hundred and twenty francs, monsieur."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Forty-five dollars a year," I said. "Bah! you are worth     more, Jean. Will you take care of my garden for me? My wife     wished me to ask you. I think it would be worth one hundred     francs a month to you and to me. Come on, Le Bihan&mdash;come     along, Fortin&mdash;and you, Durand. I want somebody to     translate that list into French for me."</p></div>

Fortin leaned against the cliff,     polishing his glasses and examining us with vague, near-sighted     eyes; and Le Bihan, the mayor, planted himself in our midst,     rolling up the scroll and tucking it under his arm.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "First of all," he began in a shrill voice, "I am going to     light my pipe, and while lighting it I shall tell you what I     have heard about the attack on the fort yonder. My father told     me; his father told him."</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He jerked his head in the direction of the ruined fort, a     small, square stone structure on the sea cliff, now nothing but     crumbling walls. Then he slowly produced a tobacco pouch, a bit     of flint and tinder, and a long-stemmed pipe fitted with a     microscopical bowl of baked clay. To fill such a pipe requires     ten minutes' close attention. To smoke it to a finish takes but     four puffs. It is very Breton, this Breton pipe. It is the     crystallization of everything Breton.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Go on," said I, lighting a cigarette.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The fort," said the mayor, "was built by Louis XIV, and was     dismantled twice by the English. Louis XV restored it in 1730.     In 1760 it was carried by assault by the English. They came     across from the island of Groix&mdash;three shiploads, and they     stormed the fort and sacked St. Julien yonder, and they started     to burn St. Gildas&mdash;you can see the marks of their bullets     on my house yet; but the men of Bannalec and the men of Lorient     fell upon them with pike and scythe and blunderbuss, and those     who did not run away lie there below in the gravel pit     now&mdash;thirty-eight of them."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "And the thirty-ninth skull?" I asked, finishing my     cigarette.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The mayor had succeeded in filling his pipe, and now he     began to put his tobacco pouch away.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The thirty-ninth skull," he mumbled, holding the pipe stem     between his defective teeth&mdash;"the thirty-ninth skull is no     business of mine. I have told the Bannalec men to cease     digging."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "But what is&mdash;whose is the missing skull?" I persisted     curiously.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The mayor was busy trying to strike a spark to his tinder.     Presently he set it aglow, applied it to his pipe, took the     prescribed four puffs, knocked the ashes out of the bowl, and     gravely replaced the pipe in his pocket.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The missing skull?" he asked.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Yes," said I, impatiently.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The mayor slowly unrolled the scroll and began to read,     translating from the Breton into French. And this is what he     read:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "On the Cliffs of St. Gildas, April 13, 1760.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "On this day, by order of the Count of Soisic, general in     chief of the Breton forces now lying in Kerselec Forest, the     bodies of thirty-eight English soldiers of the 27th, 50th, and     72d regiments of Foot were buried in this spot, together with     their arms and equipments."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The mayor paused and glanced at me reflectively.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Go on, Le Bihan," I said.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "With them," continued the mayor, turning the scroll and     reading on the other side, "was buried the body of that vile     traitor who betrayed the fort to the English. The manner of his     death was as follows: By order of the most noble Count of     Soisic, the traitor was first branded upon the forehead with     the brand of an arrowhead. The iron burned through the flesh     and was pressed heavily so that the brand should even burn into     the bone of the skull. The traitor was then led out and bidden     to kneel. He admitted having guided the English from the island     of Groix. Although a priest and a Frenchman, he had violated     his priestly office to aid him in discovering the password to     the fort. This password he extorted during confession from a     young Breton girl who was in the habit of rowing across from     the island of Groix to visit her husband in the fort. When the     fort fell, this young girl, crazed by the death of her husband,     sought the Count of Soisic and told how the priest had forced     her to confess to him all she knew about the fort. The priest     was arrested at St. Gildas as he was about to cross the river     to Lorient. When arrested he cursed the girl, Marie     Trevec&mdash;&mdash;"</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "What!" I exclaimed, "Marie Trevec!"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Marie Trevec," repeated Le Bihan; "the priest cursed Marie     Trevec, and all her family and descendants. He was shot as he     knelt, having a mask of leather over his face, because the     Bretons who composed the squad of execution refused to fire at     a priest unless his face was concealed. The priest was     l'Abb&eacute; Sorgue, commonly known as the Black Priest on     account of his dark face and swarthy eyebrows. He was buried     with a stake through his heart."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Le Bihan paused, hesitated, looked at me, and handed the     manuscript back to Durand. The gendarme took it and slipped it     into the brass cylinder.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "So," said I, "the thirty-ninth skull is the skull of the     Black Priest."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Yes," said Fortin. "I hope they won't find it."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I have forbidden them to proceed," said the mayor     querulously. "You heard me, Max Fortin."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I rose and picked up my gun. M&ocirc;me came and pushed his     head into my hand.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "That's a fine dog," observed Durand, also rising.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Why don't you wish to find his skull?" I asked Le Bihan.     "It would be curious to see whether the arrow brand really     burned into the bone."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "There is something in that scroll that I didn't read to     you," said the mayor grimly. "Do you wish to know what it     is?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Of course," I replied in surprise.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Give me the scroll again, Durand," he said; then he read     from the bottom: "I, l'Abb&eacute; Sorgue, forced to write the     above by my executioners, have written it in my own blood; and     with it I leave my curse. My curse on St. Gildas, on Marie     Trevec, and on her descendants. I will come back to St. Gildas     when my remains are disturbed. Woe to that Englishman whom my     branded skull shall touch!"</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "What rot!" I said. "Do you believe it was really written in     his own blood?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I am going to test it," said Fortin, "at the request of     Monsieur le Maire. I am not anxious for the job, however."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "See," said Le Bihan, holding out the scroll to me, "it is     signed, 'L'Abb&eacute; Sorgue.'"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I glanced curiously over the paper.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "It must be the Black Priest," I said. "He was the only man     who wrote in the Breton language. This is a wonderfully     interesting discovery, for now, at last, the mystery of the     Black Priest's disappearance is cleared up. You will, of     course, send this scroll to Paris, Le Bihan?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "No," said the mayor obstinately, "it shall be buried in the     pit below where the rest of the Black Priest lies."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I looked at him and recognized that argument would be     useless. But still I said, "It will be a loss to history,     Monsieur Le Bihan."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "All the worse for history, then," said the enlightened     Mayor of St. Gildas.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        We had sauntered back to the gravel pit while speaking. The     men of Bannalec were carrying the bones of the English soldiers     toward the St. Gildas cemetery, on the cliffs to the east,     where already a knot of white-coiffed women stood in attitudes     of prayer; and I saw the somber robe of a priest among the     crosses of the little graveyard.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "They were thieves and assassins; they are dead now,"     muttered Max Fortin.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Respect the dead," repeated the Mayor of St. Gildas,     looking after the Bannalec men.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "It was written in that scroll that Marie Trevec, of Groix     Island, was cursed by the priest&mdash;she and her     descendants," I said, touching Le Bihan on the arm. "There was     a Marie Trevec who married an Yves Trevec of St.     Gildas&mdash;&mdash;"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "It is the same," said Le Bihan, looking at me     obliquely.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Oh!" said I; "then they were ancestors of my wife."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Do you fear the curse?" asked Le Bihan.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "What?" I laughed.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "There was the case of the Purple Emperor," said Max Fortin     timidly.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Startled for a moment, I faced him, then shrugged my     shoulders and kicked at a smooth bit of rock which lay near the     edge of the pit, almost embedded in gravel.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Do you suppose the Purple-Emperor drank himself crazy     because he was descended from Marie Trevec?" I asked     contemptuously.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Of course not," said Max Fortin hastily.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Of course not," piped the mayor. "I only&mdash;Hellow!     what's that you're kicking?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "What?" said I, glancing down, at the same time     involuntarily giving another kick. The smooth bit of rock     dislodged itself and rolled out of the loosened gravel at my     feet.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The thirty-ninth skull!" I exclaimed. "By jingo, it's the     noddle of the Black Priest! See! there is the arrowhead branded     on the front!"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The mayor stepped back. Max Fortin also retreated. There was     a pause, during which I looked at them, and they looked     anywhere but at me.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I don't like it," said the mayor at last, in a husky, high     voice. "I don't like it! The scroll says he will come back to     St. Gildas when his remains are disturbed. I&mdash;I don't like     it, Monsieur Darrel&mdash;"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Bosh!" said I; "the poor wicked devil is where he can't get     out. For Heaven's sake, Le Bihan, what is this stuff you are     talking in the year of grace 1896?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The mayor gave me a look.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "And he says 'Englishman.' You are an Englishman, Monsieur     Darrel," he announced.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "You know better. You know I'm an American."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "It's all the same," said the Mayor of St. Gildas,     obstinately.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "No, it isn't!" I answered, much exasperated, and     deliberately pushed the skull till it rolled into the bottom of     the gravel pit below.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Cover it up," said I; "bury the scroll with it too, if you     insist, but I think you ought to send it to Paris. Don't look     so gloomy, Fortin, unless you believe in werewolves and ghosts.     Hey! what the&mdash;what the devil's the matter with you,     anyway? What are you staring at, Le Bihan?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Come, come," muttered the mayor in a low, tremulous voice,     "it's time we got out of this. Did you see? Did you see,     Fortin?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I saw," whispered Max Fortin, pallid with fright.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The two men were almost running across the sunny pasture     now, and I hastened after them, demanding to know what was the     matter.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Matter!" chattered the mayor, gasping with exasperation and     terror. "The skull is rolling up hill again," and he burst into     a terrified gallop, Max Fortin followed close behind.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I watched them stampeding across the pasture, then turned     toward the gravel pit, mystified, incredulous. The skull was     lying on the edge of the pit, exactly where it had been before     I pushed it over the edge. For a second I stared at it; a     singular chilly feeling crept up my spinal column, and I turned     and walked away, sweat starting from the root of every hair on     my head. Before I had gone twenty paces the absurdity of the     whole thing struck me. I halted, hot with shame and annoyance,     and retraced my steps.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        There lay the skull.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I rolled a stone down instead of the skull," I muttered to     myself. Then with the butt of my gun I pushed the skull over     the edge of the pit and watched it roll to the bottom; and as     it struck the bottom of the pit, M&ocirc;me, my dog, suddenly     whipped his tail between his legs, whimpered, and made off     across the moor.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "M&ocirc;me!" I shouted, angry and astonished; but the dog     only fled the faster, and I ceased calling from sheer     surprise.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "What the mischief is the matter with that dog!" I thought.     He had never before played me such a trick.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Mechanically I glanced into the pit, but I could not see the     skull. I looked down. The skull lay at my feet again, touching     them.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Good heavens!" I stammered, and struck at it blindly with     my gunstock. The ghastly thing flew into the air, whirling over     and over, and rolled again down the sides of the pit to the     bottom. Breathlessly I stared at it, then, confused and     scarcely comprehending, I stepped back from the pit, still     facing it, one, ten, twenty paces, my eyes almost starting from     my head, as though I expected to see the thing roll up from the     bottom of the pit under my very gaze. At last I turned my back     to the pit and strode out across the gorse-covered moorland     toward my home. As I reached the road that winds from St.     Gildas to St. Julien I gave one hasty glance at the pit over my     shoulder. The sun shone hot on the sod about the excavation.     There was something white and bare and round on the turf at the     edge of the pit. It might have been a stone; there were plenty     of them lying about.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p class='section_break'>II</p>When I entered my garden I saw M&ocirc;me sprawling on the     stone doorstep. He eyed me sideways and flopped his tail.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Are you not mortified, you idiot dog?" I said, looking     about the upper windows for Lys.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        M&ocirc;me rolled over on his back and raised one     deprecating forepaw, as though to ward off calamity.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Don't act as though I was in the habit of beating you to     death," I said, disgusted. I had never in my life raised whip     to the brute. "But you are a fool dog," I continued. "No, you     needn't come to be babied and wept over; Lys can do that, if     she insists, but I am ashamed of you, and you can go to the     devil."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        M&ocirc;me slunk off into the house, and I followed,     mounting directly to my wife's boudoir. It was empty.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Where has she gone?" I said, looking hard at M&ocirc;me,     who had followed me. "Oh! I see you don't know. Don't pretend     you do. Come off that lounge! Do you think Lys wants     tan-colored hairs all over her lounge?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I rang the bell for Catherine and Fine, but they didn't know     where "madame" had gone; so I went into my room, bathed,     exchanged my somewhat grimy shooting clothes for a suit of     warm, soft knickerbockers, and, after lingering some extra     moments over my toilet&mdash;for I was particular, now that I     had married Lys&mdash;I went down to the garden and took a     chair out under the fig-trees.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Where can she be?" I wondered, M&ocirc;me came sneaking out     to be comforted, and I forgave him for Lys's sake, whereupon he     frisked.</p></div>

If you do it again I'll push you along     with a charge of dust shot."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        As yet I had scarcely dared think about the ghastly     hallucination of which I had been a victim, but now I faced it     squarely, flushing a little with mortification at the thought     of my hasty retreat from the gravel pit.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "To think," I said aloud, "that those old woman's tales of     Max Fortin and Le Bihan should have actually made me see what     didn't exist at all! I lost my nerve like a schoolboy in a dark     bedroom." For I knew now that I had mistaken a round stone for     a skull each time, and had pushed a couple of big pebbles into     the pit instead of the skull itself.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "By jingo!" said I, "I'm nervous; my liver must be in a     devil of a condition if I see such things when I'm awake! Lys     will know what to give me."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I felt mortified and irritated and sulky, and thought     disgustedly of Le Bihan and Max Fortin.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        But after a while I ceased speculating, dismissed the mayor,     the chemist, and the skull from my mind, and smoked pensively,     watching the sun low dipping in the western ocean. As the     twilight fell for a moment over ocean and moorland, a wistful,     restless happiness filled my heart, the happiness that all men     know&mdash;all men who have loved.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Slowly the purple mist crept out over the sea; the cliffs     darkened; the forest was shrouded.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Suddenly the sky above burned with the afterglow, and the     world was alight again.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Cloud after cloud caught the rose dye; the cliffs were     tinted with it; moor and pasture, heather and forest burned and     pulsated with the gentle flush. I saw the gulls turning and     tossing above the sand bar, their snowy wings tipped with pink;     I saw the sea swallows sheering the surface of the still river,     stained to its placid depths with warm reflections of the     clouds. The twitter of drowsy hedge birds broke out in the     stillness; a salmon rolled its shining side above     tidewater.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The interminable monotone of the ocean intensified the     silence. I sat motionless, holding my breath as one who listens     to the first low rumor of an organ. All at once the pure     whistle of a nightingale cut the silence, and the first     moonbeam silvered the wastes of mist-hung waters.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I raised my head.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Lys stood before me in the garden.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        When we had kissed each other, we linked arms and moved up     and down the gravel walks, watching the moonbeams sparkle on     the sand bar as the tide ebbed and ebbed. The broad beds of     white pinks about us were atremble with hovering white moths;     the October roses hung all abloom, perfuming the salt wind.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Sweetheart," I said, "where is Yvonne? Has she promised to     spend Christmas with us?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Yes, Dick; she drove me down from Plougat this afternoon.     She sent her love to you. I am not jealous. What did you     shoot?"</p></div>

So she dragged me off to inspect the     rather meager game bag, and she paid me pretty compliments, and     gave a little cry of delight and pity as I lifted the enormous     hare out of the sack by his ears.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "He'll eat no more of our lettuce," I said attempting to     justify the assassination.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Unhappy little bunny&mdash;and what a beauty!

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Before I could knock at Lys's door it opened, and Lys came     hastily out. When she saw me she gave a little cry of relief,     and nestled close to my breast.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "There is something peering in at my window," she said.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "What!" I cried angrily.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "A man, I think, disguised as a priest, and he has a mask     on. He must have climbed up by the bay tree."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I was down the stairs and out of doors in no time. The     moonlit garden was absolutely deserted. Tregunc came up, and     together we searched the hedge and shrubbery around the house     and out to the road.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Jean Marie," said I at length, "loose my bulldog&mdash;he     knows you&mdash;and take your supper on the porch where you can     watch. My wife says the fellow is disguised as a priest, and     wears a mask."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Tregunc showed his white teeth in a smile. "He will not care     to venture in here again, I think, Monsieur Darrel."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I went back and found Lys seated quietly at the table.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The soup is ready, dear," she said. "Don't worry; it was     only some foolish lout from Bannalec. No one in St. Gildas or     St. Julien would do such a thing."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I was too much exasperated to reply at first, but Lys     treated it as a stupid joke, and after a while I began to look     at it in that light.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Lys told me about Yvonne, and reminded me of my promise to     have Herbert Stuart down to meet her.</p></div>

Not much!" I said.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Who is, then?" urged Lys.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I laughed a trifle sheepishly.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I suppose you mean me, Dick," said Lys, coloring up.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Now I bore you, don't I?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Bore me?

"I     don't believe you are sixteen yet."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        She pushed back her heavy burnished hair thoughtfully. Her     wrist was as white as surf foam.</p></div>

"Do you think it will fit?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Fit?" repeated Lys.

A delicate color touched her cheeks     and neck. She held up the little garment, all fluffy with misty     lace and wrought with quaint embroidery.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "It is very gorgeous," said I; "don't use your eyes too     much, dearest. May I smoke a pipe?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Of course," she said selecting a skein of pale blue     silk.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        For a while I sat and smoked in silence, watching her     slender fingers among the tinted silks and thread of gold.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Presently she spoke: "What did you say your crest is,     Dick?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "My crest?

I replied evasively.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "You shall see. Ring for Josephine."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I rang, and, when 'Fine appeared, Lys gave her some orders     in a low voice, and Josephine trotted away, bobbing her     white-coiffed head with a "Bien, Madame!"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        After a few minutes she returned, bearing a tattered, musty     volume, from which the gold and blue had mostly     disappeared.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I took the book in my hands and examined the ancient     emblazoned covers.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Lilies!" I exclaimed.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Fleur-de-lis," said my wife demurely.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Oh!" said I, astonished, and opened the book.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "You have never before seen this book?" asked Lys, with a     touch of malice in her eyes.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "You know I haven't. Hello! What's this? Oho! So there     should be a de before Trevec? Lys de Trevec? Then why in the     world did the Purple Emperor&mdash;&mdash;"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Dick!" cried Lys.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "All right," said I. "Shall I read about the Sieur de Trevec     who rode to Saladin's tent alone to seek for medicine for St.     Louise? Or shall I read about&mdash;what is it? Oh, here it is,     all down in black and white&mdash;about the Marquis de Trevec     who drowned himself before Alva's eyes rather than surrender     the banner of the fleur-de-lis to Spain? It's all written here.     But, dear, how about that soldier named Trevec who was killed     in the old fort on the cliff yonder?"</p></div>

My dear, I     drink to the king!" and I raised my wine glass and looked at     Lys.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "To the king," said Lys, flushing. She smoothed out the tiny     garment on her knees; she touched the glass with her lips; her     eyes were very sweet. I drained the glass to the king.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        After a silence I said: "I will tell the king stories. His     majesty shall be amused."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "His majesty," repeated Lys softly.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Or hers," I laughed.

"Do you, Lys?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I? No, not about a giant-killer, but I know all about the     werewolf, and Jeanne-la-Flamme, and the Man in Purple Tatters,     and&mdash;O dear me, I know lots more."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "You are very wise," said I.

It is a priest's head with an arrow-shaped     mark on the forehead, on a field&mdash;&mdash;"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I sat up and stared at my wife.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Dick, whatever is the matter?" she smiled. "The story is     there in that book. Do you care to read it? No? Shall I tell it     to you? Well, then: It happened in the third crusade. There was     a monk whom men called the Black Priest. He turned apostate,     and sold himself to the enemies of Christ. A Sieur de Trevec     burst into the Saracen camp, at the head of only one hundred     lances, and carried the Black Priest away out of the very midst     of their army."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "So that is how you come by the crest," I said quietly; but     I thought of the branded skull in the gravel pit, and     wondered.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Yes," said Lys. "The Sieur de Trevec cut the Black Priest's     head off, but first he branded him with an arrow mark on the     forehead. The book says it was a pious action, and the Sieur de     Trevec got great merit by it. But I think it was cruel, the     branding," she sighed.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Did you ever hear of any other Black Priest?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Yes. There was one in the last century, here in St. Gildas.     He cast a white shadow in the sun. He wrote in the Breton     language. Chronicles, too, I believe. I never saw them. His     name was the same as that of the old chronicler, and of the     other priest, Jacques Sorgue. Some said he was a lineal     descendant of the traitor. Of course the first Black Priest was     bad enough for anything. But if he did have a child, it need     not have been the ancestor of the last Jacques Sorgue. They say     he was so good he was not allowed to die, but was caught up to     heaven one day," added Lys, with believing eyes.</p></div>

I had utterly forgotten the masked man at her window, but     before I finished I remembered him fast enough, and realized     what I had done as I saw her face whiten.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Lys," I urged tenderly, "that was only some clumsy clown's     trick. You said so yourself. You are not superstitious, my     dear?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Her eyes were on mine. She slowly drew the little gold cross     from her bosom and kissed it.

"Has     Jean Marie been here?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "We are to be married, Monsieur Darrel," she laughed.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Ah!

Dust covered his spectacles and nose; his     hat, with the tiny velvet ribbons fluttering, was all awry.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Come in, Monsieur Darrel," he said; "the mayor and I are     packing up the effects of the Purple Emperor and of the poor     Red Admiral."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The collections?" I asked, entering the room. "You must be     very careful in packing those butterfly cases; the slightest     jar might break wings and antennas, you know."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Le Bihan shook hands with me and pointed to the great pile     of boxes.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "They're all cork lined," he said, "but Fortin and I are     putting felt around each box. The Entomological Society of     Paris pays the freight."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The combined collection of the Red Admiral and the Purple     Emperor made a magnificent display.</p></div>

I answered a trifle sharply.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "If I were you I should destroy it," said the mayor in his     high-pitched voice.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "That would be nonsense," said I, "like your burying the     brass cylinder and scroll yesterday."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "It was not nonsense," said Le Bihan doggedly, "and I should     prefer not to discuss the subject of the scroll."</p></div>

I sneered, "does the Mayor of St. Gildas and St.     Julien believe in the loup-garou?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "No, not in the loup-garou."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "In what, then&mdash;Jeanne-la-Flamme?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "That," said Le Bihan with conviction, "is history."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The devil it is!" said I; "and perhaps, Monsieur the mayor,     your faith in giants is unimpaired?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "There were giants&mdash;everybody knows it," growled Max     Fortin.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "And you a chemist!" I observed scornfully.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Listen, Monsieur Darrel," squeaked Le Bihan; "you know     yourself that the Purple Emperor was a scientific man. Now     suppose I should tell you that he always refused to include in     his collection a Death's Messenger?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "A what?" I exclaimed.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "You know what I mean&mdash;that moth that flies by night;     some call it the Death's Head, but in St. Gildas we call it     'Death's Messenger.'"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Oh!" said I, "you mean that big sphinx moth that is     commonly known as the 'death's-head moth.' Why the mischief     should the people here call it death's messenger?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "For hundreds of years it has been known as death's     messenger in St. Gildas," said Max Fortin. "Even Froissart     speaks of it in his commentaries on Jacques Sorgue's     <i>Chronicles</i>. The book is in your library."</p></div>

I never read his     book."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Jacques Sorgue was the son of some unfrocked priest&mdash;I forget. It          was during the crusades."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Good Heavens!" I burst out, "I've been hearing of nothing     but crusades and priests and death and sorcery ever since I     kicked that skull into the gravel pit, and I am tired of it, I     tell you frankly. One would think we lived in the dark ages. Do     you know what year of our Lord it is, Le Bihan?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Eighteen hundred and ninety-six," replied the mayor.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "And yet you two hulking men are afraid of a death's-head     moth."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I don't care to have one fly into the window," said Max     Fortin; "it means evil to the house and the people in it."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "God alone knows why he marked one of his creatures with a     yellow death's head on the back," observed Le Bihan piously,     "but I take it that he meant it as a warning; and I propose to     profit by it," he added triumphantly.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "See here, Le Bihan," I said; "by a stretch of imagination     one can make out a skull on the thorax of a certain big sphinx     moth. What of it?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "It is a bad thing to touch," said the mayor wagging his     head.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "It squeaks when handled," added Max Fortin.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Some creatures squeak all the time," I observed, looking     hard at Le Bihan.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Pigs," added the mayor.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Yes, and asses," I replied. "Listen, Le Bihan: do you mean     to tell me that you saw that skull roll uphill yesterday?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The mayor shut his mouth tightly and picked up his     hammer.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Don't be obstinate," I said; "I asked you a question."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "And I refuse to answer," snapped Le Bihan. "Fortin saw what     I saw; let him talk about it."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I looked searchingly at the little chemist.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I don't say that I saw it actually roll up out of the pit,     all by itself," said Fortin with a shiver, "but&mdash;but then,     how did it come up out of the pit, if it didn't roll up all by     itself?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "It didn't come up at all; that was a yellow cobblestone     that you mistook for the skull again," I replied. "You were     nervous, Max."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "A&mdash;a very curious cobblestone, Monsieur Darrel," said     Fortin.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I also was a victim to the same hallucination," I     continued, "and I regret to say that I took the trouble to roll     two innocent cobblestones into the gravel pit, imagining each     time that it was the skull I was rolling."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "It was," observed Le Bihan with a morose shrug.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "It just shows," said I, ignoring the mayor's remark, "how     easy it is to fix up a train of coincidences so that the result     seems to savor of the supernatural. Now, last night my wife     imagined that she saw a priest in a mask peer in at her     window&mdash;&mdash;"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Fortin and Le Bihan scrambled hastily from their knees,     dropping hammer and nails.</p></div>

Max Fortin turned livid.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "My God!" muttered Le Bihan, "the Black Priest is in St.     Gildas!"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "D-don't you&mdash;you know the old prophecy?" stammered     Fortin; "Froissart quotes it from Jacques Sorgue:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "'When the Black Priest rises from the dead,</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        St. Gildas folk shall shriek in bed;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        When the Black Priest rises from his grave,</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        May the good God St. Gildas save!'"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Aristide Le Bihan," I said angrily, "and you, Max Fortin,     I've got enough of this nonsense! Some foolish lout from     Bannalec has been in St. Gildas playing tricks to frighten old     fools like you. If you have nothing better to talk about than     nursery legends I'll wait until you come to your senses.     Good-morning." And I walked out, more disturbed than I cared to     acknowledge to myself.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The day had become misty and overcast. Heavy, wet clouds     hung in the east. I heard the surf thundering against the     cliffs, and the gray gulls squealed as they tossed and turned     high in the sky. The tide was creeping across the river sands,     higher, higher, and I saw the seaweed floating on the beach,     and the lancons springing from the foam, silvery threadlike     flashes in the gloom. Curlew were flying up the river in twos     and threes; the timid sea swallows skimmed across the moors     toward some quiet, lonely pool, safe from the coming tempest.     In every hedge field birds were gathering, huddling together,     twittering restlessly.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        When I reached the cliffs I sat down, resting my chin on my     clenched hands. Already a vast curtain of rain, sweeping across     the ocean miles away, hid the island of Groix. To the east,     behind the white semaphore on the hills, black clouds crowded     up over the horizon. After a little the thunder boomed, dull,     distant, and slender skeins of lightning unraveled across the     crest of the coming storm. Under the cliff at my feet the surf     rushed foaming over the shore, and the lancons jumped and     skipped and quivered until they seemed to be but the     reflections of the meshed lightning.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I turned to the east. It was raining over Groix, it was     raining at Sainte Barbe, it was raining now at the semaphore.     High in the storm whirl a few gulls pitched; a nearer cloud     trailed veils of rain in its wake; the sky was spattered with     lightning; the thunder boomed.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        As I rose to go, a cold raindrop fell upon the back of my     hand, and another, and yet another on my face. I gave a last     glance at the sea, where the waves were bursting into strange     white shapes that seemed to fling out menacing arms toward me.     Then something moved on the cliff, something black as the black     rock it clutched&mdash;a filthy cormorant, craning its hideous     head at the sky.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Slowly I plodded homeward across the somber moorland, where     the gorse stems glimmered with a dull metallic green, and the     heather, no longer violet and purple, hung drenched and     dun-colored among the dreary rocks. The wet turf creaked under     my heavy boots, the black-thorn scraped and grated against knee     and elbow. Over all lay a strange light, pallid, ghastly, where     the sea spray whirled across the landscape and drove into my     face until it grew numb with the cold. In broad bands, rank     after rank, billow on billow, the rain burst out across the     endless moors, and yet there was no wind to drive it at such a     pace.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Lys stood at the door as I turned into the garden, motioning     me to hasten; and then for the first time I became conscious     that I was soaked to the skin.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "However in the world did you come to stay out when such a     storm threatened?" she said. "Oh, you are dripping! Go quickly     and change; I have laid your warm underwear on the bed,     Dick."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I kissed my wife, and went upstairs to change my dripping     clothes for something more comfortable.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        When I returned to the morning room there was a driftwood     fire on the hearth, and Lys sat in the chimney corner     embroidering.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Catherine tells me that the fishing fleet from Lorient is     out. Do you think they are in danger, dear?" asked Lys, raising     her blue eyes to mine as I entered.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "There is no wind, and there will be no sea," said I,     looking out of the window. Far across the moor I could see the     black cliffs looming in the mist.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "How it rains!" murmured Lys; "come to the fire, Dick."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I threw myself on the fur rug, my hands in my pockets, my     head on Lys's knees.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Tell me a story," I said. "I feel like a boy of ten."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Lys raised a finger to her scarlet lips. I always waited for     her to do that.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Will you be very still, then?" she said.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Still as death."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Death," echoed a voice, very softly.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Did you speak, Lys?" I asked, turning so that I could see     her face.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "No; did you, Dick?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Who said 'death'?" I asked, startled.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Death," echoed a voice, softly.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I sprang up and looked about. Lys rose too, her needles and     embroidery falling to the floor. She seemed about to faint,     leaning heavily on me, and I led her to the window and opened     it a little way to give her air. As I did so the chain     lightning split the zenith, the thunder crashed, and a sheet of     rain swept into the room, driving with it something that     fluttered&mdash;something that flapped, and squeaked, and beat     upon the rug with soft, moist wings.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        We bent over it together, Lys clinging to me, and we saw     that it was a death's-head moth drenched with rain.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The dark day passed slowly as we sat beside the fire, hand     in hand, her head against my breast, speaking of sorrow and     mystery and death. For Lys believed that there were things on     earth that none might understand, things that must be nameless     forever and ever, until God rolls up the scroll of life and all     is ended. We spoke of hope and fear and faith, and the mystery     of the saints; we spoke of the beginning and the end, of the     shadow of sin, of omens, and of love. The moth still lay on the     floor quivering its somber wings in the warmth of the fire, the     skull and ribs clearly etched upon its neck and body.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "If it is a messenger of death to this house," I said, "why     should we fear, Lys?"</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Death should be welcome to those who love God," murmured     Lys, and she drew the cross from her breast and kissed it.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The moth might die if I threw it out into the storm," I     said after a silence.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Let it remain," sighed Lys.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Late that night my wife lay sleeping, and I sat beside her     bed and read in the Chronicle of Jacques Sorgue. I shaded the     candle, but Lys grew restless, and finally I took the book down     into the morning room, where the ashes of the fire rustled and     whitened on the hearth.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The death's-head moth lay on the rug before the fire where I     had left it. At first I thought it was dead, but when I looked     closer I saw a lambent fire in its amber eyes. The straight     white shadow it cast across the floor wavered as the candle     flickered.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The pages of the Chronicle of Jacques Sorgue were damp and     sticky; the illuminated gold and blue initials left flakes of     azure and gilt where my hand brushed them.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "It is not paper at all; it is thin parchment," I said to     myself; and I held the discolored page close to the candle     flame and read, translating laboriously:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I, Jacques Sorgue, saw all these things. And I saw the     Black Mass celebrated in the chapel of St. Gildas-on-the-Cliff.     And it was said by the Abb&eacute; Sorgue, my kinsman: for     which deadly sin the apostate priest was seized by the most     noble Marquis of Plougastel and by him condemned to be burned     with hot irons, until his seared soul quit its body and fly to     its master the devil. But when the Black Priest lay in the     crypt of Plougastel, his master Satan came at night and set him     free, and carried him across land and sea to Mahmoud, which is     Soldan or Saladin. And I, Jacques Sorgue, traveling afterward     by sea, beheld with my own eyes my kinsman, the Black Priest of     St. Gildas, borne along in the air upon a vast black wing,     which was the wing of his master Satan. And this was seen also     by two men of the crew."</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I turned the page. The wings of the moth on the floor began     to quiver. I read on and on, my eyes blurring under the     shifting candle flame. I read of battles and of saints, and I     learned how the Great Soldan made his pact with Satan, and then     I came to the Sieur de Trevec, and read how he seized the Black     Priest in the midst of Saladin's tents and carried him away and     cut off his head first branding him on the forehead. "And     before he suffered," said the Chronicle, "he cursed the Sieur     de Trevec and his descendants, and he said he would surely     return to St. Gildas. 'For the violence you do to me, I will do     violence to you. For the evil I suffer at your hands, I will     work evil on you and your descendants. Woe to your children,     Sieur de Trevec!'" There was a whirr, a beating of strong     wings, and my candle flashed up as in a sudden breeze. A     humming filled the room; the great moth darted hither and     thither, beating, buzzing, on ceiling and wall. I flung down my     book and stepped forward. Now it lay fluttering upon the window     sill, and for a moment I had it under my hand, but the thing     squeaked and I shrank back. Then suddenly it darted across the     candle flame; the light flared and went out, and at the same     moment a shadow moved in the darkness outside. I raised my eyes     to the window. A masked face was peering in at me.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Quick as thought I whipped out my revolver and fired every     cartridge, but the face advanced beyond the window, the glass     melting away before it like mist, and through the smoke of my     revolver I saw something creep swiftly into the room. Then I     tried to cry out, but the thing was at my throat, and I fell     backward among the ashes of the hearth.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        When my eyes unclosed I was lying on the hearth, my head     among the cold ashes. Slowly I got on my knees, rose painfully,     and groped my way to a chair. On the floor lay my revolver,     shining in the pale light of early morning. My mind clearing by     degrees, I looked, shuddering, at the window. The glass was     unbroken. I stooped stiffly, picked up my revolver and opened     the cylinder. Every cartridge had been fired. Mechanically I     closed the cylinder and placed the revolver in my pocket. The     book, the Chronicles of Jacques Sorgue, lay on the table beside     me, and as I started to close it I glanced at the page. It was     all splashed with rain, and the lettering had run, so that the     page was merely a confused blur of gold and red and black. As I     stumbled toward the door I cast a fearful glance over my     shoulder. The death's-head moth crawled shivering on the     rug.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class='section_break'>IV</p><p>The sun was about three hours high. I must have slept, for I     was aroused by the sudden gallop of horses under our window.     People were shouting and calling in the road. I sprang up and     opened the sash. Le Bihan was there, an image of helplessness,     and Max Fortin stood beside him polishing his glasses. Some     gendarmes had just arrived from Quimperle, and I could hear     them around the corner of the house, stamping, and rattling     their sabres and carbines, as they led their horses into my     stable.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Lys sat up, murmuring half-sleepy, half-anxious     questions.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I don't know," I answered. "I am going out to see what it     means."</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "It is like the day they came to arrest you," Lys said,     giving me a troubled look. But I kissed her and laughed at her     until she smiled too. Then I flung on coat and cap and hurried     down the stairs.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The first person I saw standing in the road was the     Brigadier Durand.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Hello!" said I, "have you come to arrest me again? What the     devil is all this fuss about, anyway?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "We were telegraphed for an hour ago," said Durand briskly,     "and for a sufficient reason, I think. Look there, Monsieur     Darrel!"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He pointed to the ground almost under my feet.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Good heavens!" I cried, "where did that puddle of blood     come from?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "That's what I want to know, Monsieur Darrel. Max Fortin     found it at daybreak. See, it's splashed all over the grass,     too. A trail of it leads into your garden, across the flower     beds to your very window, the one that opens from the morning     room. There is another trail leading from this spot across the     road to the cliffs, then to the gravel pit, and thence across     the moor to the forest of Kerselec. We are going to mount in a     minute and search the bosquets. Will you join us? Bon Dieu! but     the fellow bled like an ox. Max Fortin says it's human blood,     or I should not have believed it."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The little chemist of Quimperle came up at that moment,     rubbing his glasses with a colored handkerchief.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Yes, it is human blood," he said, "but one thing puzzles     me: the corpuscles are yellow. I never saw any human blood     before with yellow corpuscles. But your English Doctor Thompson     asserts that he has&mdash;&mdash;"</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Well, it's human blood, anyway&mdash;isn't it?" insisted     Durand, impatiently.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Ye-es," admitted Max Fortin.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Then it's my business to trail it," said the big gendarme,     and he called his men and gave the order to mount.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Did you hear anything last night?" asked Durand of me.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I heard the rain. I wonder the rain did not wash away these     traces."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "They must have come after the rain ceased. See this thick     splash, how it lies over and weighs down the wet grass blades.     Pah!"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        It was a heavy, evil-looking clot, and I stepped back from     it, my throat closing in disgust.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "My theory," said the brigadier, "is this: Some of those     Biribi fishermen, probably the Icelanders, got an extra glass     of cognac into their hides and quarreled on the road. Some of     them were slashed, and staggered to your house. But there is     only one trail, and yet&mdash;and yet, how could all that blood     come from only one person? Well, the wounded man, let us say,     staggered first to your house and then back here, and he     wandered off, drunk and dying, God knows where. That's my     theory."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "A very good one," said I calmly. "And you are going to     trail him?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Yes."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "When?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "At once. Will you come?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Not now. I'll gallop over by-and-bye. You are going to the     edge of the Kerselec forest?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Yes; you will hear us calling. Are you coming, Max Fortin?     And you, Le Bihan? Good; take the dog-cart."</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The big gendarme tramped around the corner to the stable and     presently returned mounted on a strong gray horse, his sabre     shone on his saddle; his pale yellow and white facings were     spotless. The little crowd of white-coiffed women with their     children fell back as Durand touched spurs and clattered away     followed by his two troopers. Soon after Le Bihan and Max     Fortin also departed in the mayor's dingy dog-cart.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Are you coming?" piped Le Bihan shrilly.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "In a quarter of an hour," I replied, and went back to the     house.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        When I opened the door of the morning room the death's-head     moth was beating its strong wings against the window. For a     second I hesitated, then walked over and opened the sash. The     creature fluttered out, whirred over the flower beds a moment,     then darted across the moorland toward the sea. I called the     servants together and questioned them. Josephine, Catherine,     Jean Marie Tregunc, not one of them had heard the slightest     disturbance during the night. Then I told Jean Marie to saddle     my horse, and while I was speaking Lys came down.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Dearest," I began, going to her.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "You must tell me everything you know, Dick," she     interrupted, looking me earnestly in the face.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "But there is nothing to tell&mdash;only a drunken brawl,     and some one wounded."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "And you are going to ride&mdash;where, Dick?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Well, over to the edge of Kerselec forest. Durand and the     mayor, and Max Fortin, have gone on, following a&mdash;a     trail."</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "What trail?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Some blood."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Where did they find it?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Out in the road there." Lys crossed herself.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Does it come near our house?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Yes."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "How near?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "It comes up to the morning room window," said I, giving     in.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Her hand on my arm grew heavy. "I dreamed last     night&mdash;&mdash;"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "So did I&mdash;" but I thought of the empty cartridges in     my revolver, and stopped.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I dreamed that you were in great danger, and I could not     move hand or foot to save you; but you had your revolver, and I     called out to you to fire&mdash;&mdash;"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I did fire!" I cried excitedly.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "You&mdash;you fired?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I took her in my arms. "My darling," I said "something     strange has happened&mdash;something that I cannot understand     as yet. But, of course, there is an explanation. Last night I     thought I fired at the Black Priest."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Ah!" gasped Lys.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Is that what you dreamed?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Yes, yes, that was it! I begged you to     fire&mdash;&mdash;"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "And I did."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Her heart was beating against my breast. I held her close in     silence.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Dick," she said at length, "perhaps you killed     the&mdash;the thing."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "If it was human I did not miss," I answered grimly. "And it     was human," I went on, pulling myself together, ashamed of     having so nearly gone to pieces. "Of course it was human! The     whole affair is plain enough. Not a drunken brawl, as Durand     thinks; it was a drunken lout's practical joke, for which he     has suffered. I suppose I must have filled him pretty full of     bullets, and he has crawled away to die in Kerselec forest.     It's a terrible affair; I'm sorry I fired so hastily; but that     idiot Le Bihan and Max Fortin have been working on my nerves     till I am as hysterical as a schoolgirl," I ended angrily.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "You fired&mdash;but the window glass was not shattered,"     said Lys in a low voice.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Well, the window was open, then. And as for the&mdash;the     rest&mdash;I've got nervous indigestion, and a doctor will     settle the Black Priest for me, Lys."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I glanced out of the window at Tregunc waiting with my horse     at the gate.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Dearest, I think I had better go to join Durand and the     others."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I will go, too."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Oh, no!"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Yes, Dick."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Don't, Lys."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I shall suffer every moment you are away."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The ride is too fatiguing, and we can't tell what     unpleasant sight you may come upon. Lys, you don't really think     there is anything supernatural in this affair?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Dick," she answered gently, "I am a Bretonne." With both     arms around my neck, my wife said, "Death is the gift of God. I     do not fear it when we are together. But alone&mdash;oh, my     husband, I should fear a God who could take you away from     me!"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        We kissed each other soberly, simply, like two children.     Then Lys hurried away to change her gown, and I paced up and     down the garden waiting for her.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        She came, drawing on her slender gauntlets. I swung her into     the saddle, gave a hasty order to Jean Marie, and mounted.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Now, to quail under thoughts of terror on a morning like     this, with Lys in the saddle beside me, no matter what had     happened or might happen was impossible. Moreover, M&ocirc;me     came sneaking after us. I asked Tregunc to catch him, for I was     afraid he might be brained by our horses' hoofs if he followed,     but the wily puppy dodged and bolted after Lys, who was     trotting along the highroad. "Never mind," I thought; "if he's     hit he'll live, for he has no brains to lose."</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Lys was waiting for me in the road beside the Shrine of Our     Lady of St. Gildas when I joined her. She crossed herself, I     doffed my cap, then we shook out our bridles and galloped     toward the forest of Kerselec.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        We said very little as we rode. I always loved to watch Lys     in the saddle. Her exquisite figure and lovely face were the     incarnation of youth and grace; her curling hair glistened like     threaded gold.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Out of the corner of my eye I saw the spoiled puppy     M&ocirc;me come bounding cheerfully alongside, oblivious of our     horses' heels. Our road swung close to the cliffs. A filthy     cormorant rose from the black rocks and flapped heavily across     our path. Lys's horse reared, but she pulled him down, and     pointed at the bird with her riding crop.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I see," said I; "it seems to be going our way. Curious to     see a cormorant in a forest, isn't it?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "It is a bad sign," said Lys. "You know the Morbihan     proverb: 'When the cormorant turns from the sea, Death laughs     in the forest, and wise woodsmen build boats.'"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I wish," said I sincerely, "that there were fewer proverbs     in Brittany."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        We were in sight of the forest now; across the gorse I could     see the sparkle of gendarmes' trappings, and the glitter of Le     Bihan's silver-buttoned jacket. The hedge was low and we took     it without difficulty, and trotted across the moor to where Le     Bihan and Durand stood gesticulating.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        They bowed ceremoniously to Lys as we rode up.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The trail is horrible&mdash;it is a river," said the mayor     in his squeaky voice. "Monsieur Darrel, I think perhaps madame     would scarcely care to come any nearer."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Lys drew bridle and looked at me.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "It is horrible!" said Durand, walking up beside me; "it     looks as though a bleeding regiment had passed this way. The     trail winds and winds about here in the thickets; we lose it at     times, but we always find it again. I can't understand how one     man&mdash;no, nor twenty&mdash;could bleed like that!"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        A halloo, answered by another, sounded from the depths of     the forest.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "It's my men; they are following the trail," muttered the     brigadier. "God alone knows what is at the end!"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Shall we gallop back, Lys?" I asked.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "No; let us ride along the western edge of the woods and     dismount. The sun is so hot now, and I should like to rest for     a moment," she said.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The western forest is clear of anything disagreeable," said     Durand.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Very well," I answered; "call me, Le Bihan, if you find     anything."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Lys wheeled her mare, and I followed across the springy     heather, M&ocirc;me trotting cheerfully in the rear.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        We entered the sunny woods about a quarter of a kilometer     from where we left Durand. I took Lys from her horse, flung     both bridles over a limb, and, giving my wife my arm, aided her     to a flat mossy rock which overhung a shallow brook gurgling     among the beech trees. Lys sat down and drew off her gauntlets.     M&ocirc;me pushed his head into her lap, received an undeserved     caress, and came doubtfully toward me. I was weak enough to     condone his offense, but I made him lie down at my feet,     greatly to his disgust.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I rested my head on Lys's knees, looking up at the sky     through the crossed branches of the trees.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I suppose I have killed him," I said. "It shocks me     terribly, Lys."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "You could not have known, dear. He may have been a robber,     and&mdash;if&mdash;not&mdash;did&mdash;have you ever fired your     revolver since that day four years ago when the Red Admiral's     son tried to kill you? But I know you have not."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "No," said I, wondering. "It's a fact, I have not. Why?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "And don't you remember that I asked you to let me load it     for you the day when Yves went off, swearing to kill you and     his father?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Yes, I do remember. Well?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Well, I&mdash;I took the cartridges first to St. Gildas     chapel and dipped them in holy water. You must not laugh,     Dick," said Lys gently, laying her cool hands on my lips.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Laugh, my darling!"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Overhead the October sky was pale amethyst, and the sunlight     burned like orange flame through the yellow leaves of beech and     oak. Gnats and midges danced and wavered overhead; a spider     dropped from a twig halfway to the ground and hung suspended on     the end of his gossamer thread.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Are you sleepy, dear?" asked Lys, bending over me.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I am&mdash;a little; I scarcely slept two hours last     night," I answered.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "You may sleep, if you wish," said Lys, and touched my eyes     caressingly.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Is my head heavy on your knees?"</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "No, Dick."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I was already in a half doze; still I heard the brook     babbling under the beeches and the humming of forest flies     overhead. Presently even these were stilled.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The next thing I knew I was sitting bolt upright, my ears     ringing with a scream, and I saw Lys cowering beside me,     covering her white face with both hands.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        As I sprang to my feet she cried again and clung to my     knees. I saw my dog rush growling into a thicket, then I heard     him whimper, and he came backing out, whining, ears flat, tail     down. I stooped and disengaged Lys's hand.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Don't go, Dick!" she cried. "O God, it's the Black     Priest!"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        In a moment I had leaped across the brook and pushed my way     into the thicket. It was empty. I stared about me; I scanned     every tree trunk, every bush. Suddenly I saw him. He was seated     on a fallen log, his head resting in his hands, his rusty black     robe gathered around him. For a moment my hair stirred under my     cap; sweat started on forehead and cheek bone; then I recovered     my reason, and understood that the man was human and was     probably wounded to death. Ay, to death; for there at my feet,     lay the wet trail of blood, over leaves and stones, down into     the little hollow, across to the figure in black resting     silently under the trees.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I saw that he could not escape even if he had the strength,     for before him, almost at his very feet, lay a deep, shining     swamp.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        As I stepped forward my foot broke a twig. At the sound the     figure started a little, then its head fell forward again. Its     face was masked. Walking up to the man, I bade him tell where     he was wounded. Durand and the others broke through the thicket     at the same moment and hurried to my side.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Who are you who hide a masked face in a priest's robe?"     said the gendarme loudly.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        There was no answer.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "See&mdash;see the stiff blood all over his robe," muttered     Le Bihan to Fortin.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "He will not speak," said I.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "He may be too badly wounded," whispered Le Bihan.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I saw him raise his head," I said, "my wife saw him creep     up here."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Durand stepped forward and touched the figure.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Speak!" he said.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Speak!" quavered Fortin.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Durand waited a moment, then with a sudden upward movement     he stripped off the mask and threw back the man's head. We were     looking into the eye sockets of a skull. Durand stood rigid;     the mayor shrieked. The skeleton burst out from its rotting     robes and collapsed on the ground before us. From between the     staring ribs and the grinning teeth spurted a torrent of black     blood, showering the shrinking grasses; then the thing     shuddered, and fell over into the black ooze of the bog. Little     bubbles of iridescent air appeared from the mud; the bones were     slowly engulfed, and, as the last fragments sank out of sight,     up from the depths and along the bank crept a creature, shiny,     shivering, quivering its wings.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        It was a death's-head moth.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I wish I had time to tell you how Lys outgrew     superstitions&mdash;for she never knew the truth about the     affair, and she never will know, since she has promised not to     read this book. I wish I might tell you about the king and his     coronation, and how the coronation robe fitted. I wish that I     were able to write how Yvonne and Herbert Stuart rode to a boar     hunt in Quimperle, and how the hounds raced the quarry right     through the town, overturning three gendarmes, the notary, and     an old woman. But I am becoming garrulous and Lys is calling me     to come and hear the king say that he is sleepy. And his     highness shall not be kept waiting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote>THE KING'S CRADLE SONG<BR>       Seal with a seal of gold<BR>       The scroll of a life unrolled;<BR>       Swathe him deep in his purple stole;<BR>       Ashes of diamonds, crystalled coal,<BR>       Drops of gold in each scented fold.<BR>       Crimson wings of the Little Death,<BR>       Stir his hair with your silken breath;<BR>       Flaming wings of sins to be,<BR>       Splendid pinions of prophecy,<BR>       Smother his eyes with hues and dyes,<BR>       While the white moon spins and the winds arise,<BR>       And the stars drip through the skies.<BR>       Wave, O wings of the Little Death!<BR>       Seal his sight and stifle his breath,<BR>       Cover his breast with the gemmed shroud pressed;</blockquote></div>
