<div class="story_text" id="1"><p>A story with a moral appended is like the bill of a mosquito.  It  bores you, and then injects a stinging drop to irritate your  conscience.  Therefore let us have the moral first and be done with  it.  All is not gold that glitters, but it is a wise child that keeps the  stopper in his bottle of testing acid. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Where Broadway skirts the corner of the square presided over by  George the Veracious is the Little Rialto.  Here stand the actors of  that quarter, and this is their shibboleth:  "'Nit,' says I to Frohman,  'you can't touch me for a kopeck less than two-fifty per,' and out I  walks." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Westward and southward from the Thespian glare are one or two  streets where a Spanish-American colony has huddled for a little  tropical warmth in the nipping North.  The centre of life in this  precinct is "El Refugio," a cafe and restaurant that caters to the  volatile exiles from the South.  Up from Chili, Bolivia, Colombia,  the rolling republics of Central America and the ireful islands of  the Western Indies flit the cloaked and sombreroed senores, who  are scattered like burning lava by the political eruptions of their  several countries. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Hither they come to lay counterplots, to bide their time, to solicit  funds, to enlist filibusterers, to smuggle out arms and  ammunitions, to play the game at long taw.  In El Refugio, they  find the atmosphere in which they thrive. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        In the restaurant of El Refugio are served compounds delightful to  the palate of the man from Capricorn or Cancer.  Altruism must  halt the story thus long.  On, diner, weary of the culinary  subterfuges of the Gallic chef, hie thee to El Refugio!  There only  will you find a fish - bluefish, shad or pompano from the Gulf -  baked after the Spanish method.  Tomatoes give it color,  individuality and soul; chili colorado bestows upon it zest,  originality and fervor; unknown herbs furnish piquancy and  mystery, and - but its crowning glory deserves a new sentence.   Around it, above it, beneath it, in its vicinity - but never in it -  hovers an ethereal aura, an effluvium so rarefied and delicate that  only the Society for Psychical Research could note its origin.  Do  not say that garlic is in the fish at El Refugio.  It is not otherwise  than as if the spirit of Garlic, flitting past, has wafted one kiss that  lingers in the parsley-crowned dish as haunting as those kisses in  life, "by hopeless fancy feigned on lips that are for others."  And  then, when Conchito, the waiter, brings you a plate of brown  frijoles and carafe of wine that has never stood still between  Oporto and El Refugio - ah, Dios! </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        One day a Hamburg-American liner deposited upon Pier No. 55  Gen. Perrico Ximenes Villablanca Falcon, a passenger from  Cartagena.  The General was between a claybank and bay in  complexion, had a 42-inch waist and stood 5 feet 4 with his Du  Barry heels.  He had the mustache of a shooting-gallery proprietor,  he wore the full dress of a Texas congressman and had the  important aspect of an uninstructed delegate. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Gen. Falcon had enough English under his hat to enable him to  inquire his way to the street in which El Refugio stood.  When he  reached that neighborhood he saw a sign before a respectable red-brick house that read, "Hotel Espanol."  In the window was a  card in Spanish, "Aqui se habla Espanol."  The General entered,  sure of a congenial port. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        In the cozy office was Mrs. O'Brien, the proprietress.  She had  blond - oh, unimpeachably blond hair.  For the rest she was  amiability, and ran largely to inches around.  Gen. Falcon brushed  the floor with his broad-brimmed hat, and emitted a quantity of  Spanish, the syllables sounding like firecrackers gently popping  their way down the string of a bunch. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Spanish or Dago?" asked Mrs. O'Brien, pleasantly. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I am a Colombian, madam," said the General, proudly.  "I speak  the Spanish.  The advisment in your window say the Spanish he is  spoken here.  How is that?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Well, you've been speaking it, ain't you?" said the madam.  "I'm  sure I can't." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        At the Hotel Espanol General Falcon engaged rooms and  established himself.  At dusk he sauntered out upon the streets to  view the wonders of this roaring city of the North.  As he walked  he thought of the wonderful golden hair of Mme. O'Brien.  "It is  here," said the General to himself, no doubt in his own language,  "that one shall find the most beautiful senoras in the world.  I  have not in my Colombia viewed among our beauties one so fair.   But no!  It is not for the General Falcon to think of beauty.  It is  my country that claims my devotion." </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        At the corner of Broadway and the Little Rialto the General  became involved.  The street cars bewildered him, and the fender  of one upset him against a pushcart laden with oranges.  A cab  driver missed him an inch with a hub, and poured barbarous  execrations upon his head.  He scrambled to the sidewalk and  skipped again in terror when the whistle of a peanut-roaster puffed  a hot scream in his ear.  V'algame Dios!  What devil's city is this?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        As the General fluttered out of the streamers of passers like a  wounded snipe he was marked simultaneously as game by two  hunters.  One was "Bully" McGuire, whose system of sport  required the use of a strong arm and the misuse of an eight-inch  piece of lead pipe.  The other Nimrod of the asphalt was "Spider"  Kelley, a sportsman with more refined methods. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        In pouncing upon their self-evident prey, Mr. Kelley was a shade  the quicker.  His elbow fended accurately the onslaught of Mr.  McGuire. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "G'wan!" he commanded harshly.  "I saw it first."  McGuire slunk  away, awed by superior intelligence. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Pardon me," said Mr. Kelley, to the General, "but you got balled  up in the shuffle, didn't you?  Let me assist you."  He picked up  the General's hat and brushed the dust from it. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The ways of Mr. Kelley could not but succeed.  The General,  bewildered and dismayed by the resounding streets, welcomed his  deliverer as a caballero with a most disinterested heart. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I have a desire," said the General, "to return to the hotel of  O'Brien, in which I am stop.  Caramba! senor, there is a loudness  and rapidness of going and coming in the city of this Nueva  York." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Mr. Kelley's politeness would not suffer the distinguished  Colombian to brave the dangers of the return unaccompanied.  At  the door of the Hotel Espanol they paused.  A little lower down  on the opposite side of the street shone the modest illuminated  sign of El Refugio.  Mr. Kelley, to whom few streets were  unfamiliar, knew the place exteriorly as a "Dago joint."  All  foreigners, Mr. Kelley classed under the two heads of "Dagoes"  and Frenchmen.  He proposed to the General that they repair  thither and substantiate their acquaintance with a liquid  foundation. </p></div>

			<div class="pagers" id="4"><a href="GoldGlit.shtml.html#3"><b>&lt;</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="GoldGlit.shtml.html#4">4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="GoldGlit.shtml.html#5"><b>&gt;</b></a></div>
			
			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        An hour later found General Falcon and Mr. Kelley seated at a  table in the conspirator's corner of El Refugio.  Bottles and glasses  were between them.  For the tenth time the General confided the  secret of his mission to the Estados Unidos.  He was here, he  declared, to purchase arms - 2,000 stands of Winchester rifles - for  the Colombian revolutionists.  He had drafts in his pocket drawn  by the Cartagena Bank on its New York correspondent for  $25,000.  At other tables other revolutionists were shouting their  political secrets to their fellow-plotters; but none was as loud as  the General.  He pounded the table; he hallooed for some wine; he  roared to his friend that his errand was a secret one, and not to be  hinted at to a living soul.  Mr. Kelley himself was stirred to  sympathetic enthusiasm.  He grasped the General's hand across the  table. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Monseer," he said, earnestly, "I don't know where this country of  yours is, but I'm for it.  I guess it must be a branch of the United  States, though, for the poetry guys and the schoolmarms call us  Columbia, too, sometimes.  It's a lucky thing for you that you  butted into me to-night.  I'm the only man in New York that can  get this gun deal through for you.  The Secretary of War of the  United States is me best friend.  He's in the city now, and I'll see  him for you to-morrow.  In the meantime, monseer, you keep them  drafts tight in your inside pocket.  I'll call for you to-morrow, and  take you to see him.  Say! that ain't the District of Columbia you're  talking about, is it?" concluded Mr. Kelley, with a sudden qualm.   "You can't capture that with no 2,000 guns - it's been tried with  more." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "No, no, no!" exclaimed the General.  "It is the Republic of  Colombia - it is a g-r-reat republic on the top side of America of  the South.  Yes.  Yes." </p></div>

			<div class="pagers" id="5"><a href="GoldGlit.shtml.html#4"><b>&lt;</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="GoldGlit.shtml.html#5">5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="GoldGlit.shtml.html#6"><b>&gt;</b></a></div>
			
			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "All right," said Mr. Kelley, reassured.  "Now suppose we trek  along home and go by-by.  I'll write to the Secretary to-night and  make a date with him.  It's a ticklish job to get guns out of New  York.  McClusky himself can't do it." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        They parted at the door of the Hotel Espanol.  The General rolled  his eyes at the moon and sighed. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "It is a great country, your Nueva York," he said.  "Truly the cars  in the streets devastate one, and the engine that cooks the nuts  terribly makes a squeak in the ear.  But, ah, Senor Kelley - the  senoras with hair of much goldness, and admirable fatness - they  are magnificas!  Muy magnificas!" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Kelley went to the nearest telephone booth  and called up  McCrary's cafe, far up on Broadway.  He asked for Jimmy Dunn. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Is that Jimmy Dunn?"  asked Kelley. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Yes," came the answer. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "You're a liar," sang back Kelley, joyfully.  "Your'e the Secretary  of War.  Wait there till I come up.  I've got the finest thing down  here in the way of a fish you ever baited for.  It's a Colorado-maduro, with a gold band around it and free coupons enough to  buy a red hall lamp and a statuette of Psyche rubbering in the  brook.  I'll be up on the next car." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Jimmy Dunn was an A. M. of Crookdom.  He was an artist in the  confidence line.  He never saw a bludgeon in his life; and he  scorned knockout drops.  In fact, he would have set nothing before  an intended victim but the purest of drinks, if it had been possible  to procure such a thing in New York.  It was the ambition of  "Spider" Kelley to elevate himself into Jimmy's class. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        These two gentlemen held a conference that night at McCrary's.   Kelley explained. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "He's as easy as a gumshoe.  He's from the Island of Colombia,  where there's a strike, or a feud, or something going on, and  they've sent him up here to buy 2,000 Winchesters to arbitrate the  thing with.  He showed me two drafts for $10,000 each, and one  for $5,000 on a bank here.  'S truth, Jimmy, I felt real mad with  him because he didn't have it in thousand-dollar bills, and hand it  to me on a silver waiter.  Now, we've got to wait till he goes to the  bank and gets the money for us." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        They talked it over for two hours, and then Dunn said;  "Bring him  to No. __ Broadway, at four o'clock to-morrow afternoon." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        In due time Kelley called at the Hotel Espanol for the General.   He found the wily warrior engaged in delectable conversation with  Mrs. O'Brien. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The Secretary of War is waitin' for us," said Kelley. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The General tore himself away with an effort. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Ay, senor," he said, with a sigh, "duty makes a call.  But,  senor, the senoras of your Estados Unidos - how beauties!  For  exemplification, take you la Madame O'Brien - que magnifica!   She is one goddess - one Juno - what you call one ox-eyed Juno." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Now Mr. Kelley was a wit; and better men have been shriveled by  the fire of their own imagination. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Sure!" he said with a grin; "but you mean a peroxide Juno, don't  you?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Mrs. O'Brien heard, and lifted an auriferous head.  Her  businesslike eye rested for an instant upon the disappearing form  of Mr. Kelley.  Except in street cars one should never be  unnecessarily rude to a lady. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        When the gallant Colombian and his escort arrived at the  Broadway address, they were held in an anteroom for half an hour,  and then admitted into a well-equipped office where a  distinguished looking man, with a smooth face, wrote at a desk.   General Falcon was presented to the Secretary of War of the  United States, and his mission made known by his old friend, Mr.  Kelley. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Ah - Colombia!" said the Secretary, significantly, when he was  made to understand; "I'm afraid there will be a little difficutly in  that case.  The President and I differ in our sympathies there.  He  prefers the established government, while I -" the secretary gave  the General a mysterious but encouraging smile.  "You, of course,  know, General Falcon, that since the Tammany war, an act of  Congress has been passed requiring all manufactured arms and  ammunition exported from this country to pass through the War  Department.  Now, if I can do anything for you I will be glad to do  so to oblige my old friend, Mr. Kelley.  But it must be in absolute  secrecy, as the President, as I have said, does not regard favorably  the efforts of your revolutionary party in Colombia.  I will have my  orderly bring a list of the available arms now in the warehouse." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The Secretary struck a bell, and an orderly with the letters A. D. T.  on his cap stepped promptly into the room. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Bring me Schedule B of the small arms inventory," said the  Secretary. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The orderly quickly returned with a printed paper.  The Secretary  studied it closely. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I find," he said, "that in Warehouse 9, of Government stores, there  is shipment of 2,000 stands of Winchester rifles that were ordered  by the Sultan of Morocco, who forgot to send the cash with his  order.  Our rule is that legal-tender must be paid down at the time  of purchase.  My dear Kelley, your friend, General Falcon, shall  have this lot of arms, if he desires it, at the manufacturer's price.   And you will forgive me, I am sure, if I curtail our interview.  I am  expecting the Japanese Minister and Charles Murphy every  moment!" </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        As one result of this interview, the General was deeply grateful to  his esteemed friend, Mr. Kelley.  As another, the nimble Secretary  of War was extremely busy during the next two days buying empty  rifle cases and filling them with bricks, which were then stored in  a warehouse rented for that purpose.  As still another, when the  General returned to the Hotel Espanol, Mrs. O'Brien went up to  him, plucked a thread from his lapel, and said: </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Say, senor, I don't want to 'butt in,' but what does that monkey-faced, cat-eyed, rubber-necked tin horn tough want with you?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Sangre de mi vida!" exclaimed the General.  "Impossible it is that  you speak of my good friend, Senor Kelley." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Come into the summer garden," said Mrs. O'Brien.  "I want to  have a talk with you." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Let us suppose that an hour has elapsed. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "And you say," said the General, "that for the sum of $18,000 can  be purchased the furnishment of the house and the lease of one  year with this garden so lovely - so resembling unto the patios of  my cara Colombia?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "And dirt cheap at that," sighed the lady. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Ah, Dios!" breathed General Falcon.  "What to me is war and  politics?  This spot is one paradise.  My country it have other  brave heroes to continue the fighting.  What to me should be glory  and the shooting of mans?  Ah! no.  It is here I have found one  angel.  Let us buy the Hotel Espanol and you shall be mine, and  the money shall not be waste on guns." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Mrs. O'Brien rested her blond pompadour against the shoulder of  the Colombian patriot. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Oh, senor," she sighed, happily, "ain't you terrible!" </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Two days later was the time appointed for the delivery of the arms  to the General.  The boxes of supposed rifles were stacked in the  rented warehouse, and the Secretary of War sat upon them, waiting  for his friend Kelley to fetch the victim. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Mr. Kelley hurried, at the hour, to the Hotel Espanol.  He found  the General behind the desk adding up accounts. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I have decide," said the General, "to buy not guns.  I have to-day  buy the insides of this hotel, and there shall be marrying of the  General Perrico Ximenes Villablanca Falcon with la Madame  O'Brien." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Mr. Kelley almost strangled. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Say, you old bald-headed bottle of shoe polish," he spluttered,  "you're a swindler - that's what you are!  You've bought a boarding  house with money belonging to your infernal country, wherever it  is." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Ah," said the General, footing up a column, "that is what you call  politics.  War and revolution they are not nice.  Yes.  It is not best  that one shall always follow Minerva.  No.  It is of quite desirable  to keep hotels and be with that Juno - that ox-eyed Juno.  Ah! what  hair of the gold it is that she have!" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Mr. Kelley choked again. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Ah, Senor Kelley!" said the General, feelingly and finally, "is it  that you have never eaten of the corned beef hash that Madame  O'Brien she make?"</div>
