<div class="story_text" id="1"><p>It is, I confess, with considerable diffidence, that I     approach the strange narrative which I am about to relate. The     events which I purpose detailing are of so extraordinary a     character that I am quite prepared to meet with an unusual     amount of incredulity and scorn. I accept all such beforehand.     I have, I trust, the literary courage to face unbelief. I have,     after mature consideration resolved to narrate, in as simple     and straightforward a manner as I can compass, some facts that     passed under my observation, in the month of July last, and     which, in the annals of the mysteries of physical science, are     wholly unparalleled.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I live at No. &mdash;&mdash; Twenty-sixth Street, in New     York. The house is in some respects a curious one. It has     enjoyed for the last two years the reputation of being haunted.     It is a large and stately residence, surrounded by what was     once a garden, but which is now only a green enclosure used for     bleaching clothes. The dry basin of what has been a fountain,     and a few fruit trees ragged and unpruned, indicate that this     spot in past days was a pleasant, shady retreat, filled with     fruits and flowers and the sweet murmur of waters.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The house is very spacious. A hall of noble size leads to a     large spiral staircase winding through its center, while the     various apartments are of imposing dimensions. It was built     some fifteen or twenty years since by Mr. A&mdash;&mdash;, the     well-known New York merchant, who five years ago threw the     commercial world into convulsions by a stupendous bank fraud.     Mr. A&mdash;&mdash;, as everyone knows, escaped to Europe, and     died not long after, of a broken heart. Almost immediately     after the news of his decease reached this country and was     verified, the report spread in Twenty-sixth Street that No.     &mdash;&mdash; was haunted. Legal measures had dispossessed the     widow of its former owner, and it was inhabited merely by a     caretaker and his wife, placed there by the house agent into     whose hands it had passed for the purposes of renting or sale.     These people declared that they were troubled with unnatural     noises. Doors were opened without any visible agency. The     remnants of furniture scattered through the various rooms were,     during the night, piled one upon the other by unknown hands.     Invisible feet passed up and down the stairs in broad daylight,     accompanied by the rustle of unseen silk dresses, and the     gliding of viewless hands along the massive balusters. The     caretaker and his wife declared they would live there no     longer. The house agent laughed, dismissed them, and put others     in their place. The noises and supernatural manifestations     continued. The neighborhood caught up the story, and the house     remained untenanted for three years. Several persons negotiated     for it; but, somehow, always before the bargain was closed they     heard the unpleasant rumors and declined to treat any     further.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        It was in this state of things that my landlady, who at that     time kept a boarding-house in Bleecker Street, and who wished     to move further up town, conceived the bold idea of renting No.     &mdash;&mdash; Twenty-sixth Street. Happening to have in her     house rather a plucky and philosophical set of boarders, she     laid her scheme before us, stating candidly everything she had     heard respecting the ghostly qualities of the establishment to     which she wished to remove us. With the exception of two timid     persons,&mdash;a sea-captain and a returned Californian, who     immediately gave notice that they would leave,&mdash;all of     Mrs. Moffat's guests declared that they would accompany her in     her chivalric incursion into the abode of spirits.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Our removal was effected in the month of May, and we were     charmed with our new residence. The portion of Twenty-sixth     Street where our house is situated, between Seventh and Eighth     Avenues, is one of the pleasantest localities in New York. The     gardens back of the houses, running down nearly to the Hudson,     form, in the summer time, a perfect avenue of verdure. The air     is pure and invigorating, sweeping, as it does, straight across     the river from the Weehawken heights, and even the ragged     garden which surrounded the house, although displaying on     washing days rather too much clothesline, still gave us a piece     of greensward to look at, and a cool retreat in the summer     evenings, where we smoked our cigars in the dusk, and watched     the fireflies flashing their dark lanterns in the long     grass.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Of course we had no sooner established ourselves at No.     &mdash;&mdash; than we began to expect ghosts. We absolutely     awaited their advent with eagerness. Our dinner conversation     was supernatural. One of the boarders, who had purchased Mrs.     Crowe's <i>Night Side of Nature</i> for his own private     delectation, was regarded as a public enemy by the entire     household for not having bought twenty copies. The man led a     life of supreme wretchedness while he was reading this volume.     A system of espionage was established, of which he was the     victim. If he incautiously laid the book down for an instant     and left the room, it was immediately seized and read aloud in     secret places to a select few. I found myself a person of     immense importance, it having leaked out that I was tolerably     well versed in the history of supernaturalism, and had once     written a story the foundation of which was a ghost. If a table     or a wainscot panel happened to warp when we were assembled in     the large drawing-room, there was an instant silence, and     everyone was prepared for an immediate clanking of chains and a     spectral form.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        After a month of psychological excitement, it was with the     utmost dissatisfaction that we were forced to acknowledge that     nothing in the remotest degree approaching the supernatural had     manifested itself. Once the black butler asseverated that his     candle had been blown out by some invisible agency while he was     undressing himself for the night; but as I had more than once     discovered this colored gentleman in a condition when one     candle must have appeared to him like two, thought it possible     that, by going a step further in his potations, he might have     reversed this phenomenon, and seen no candle at all where he     ought to have beheld one.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Things were in this state when an accident took place so     awful and inexplicable in its character that my reason fairly     reels at the bare memory of the occurrence. It was the tenth of     July. After dinner was over I repaired, with my friend Dr.     Hammond, to the garden to smoke my evening pipe. Independent of     certain mental sympathies which existed between the Doctor and     myself, we were linked together by a vice. We both smoked     opium. We knew each other's secret, and respected it. We     enjoyed together that wonderful expansion of thought, that     marvelous intensifying of the perceptive faculties, that     boundless feeling of existence when we seem to have points of     contact with the whole universe,&mdash;in short, that     unimaginable spiritual bliss, which I would not surrender for a     throne, and which I hope you, reader, will never&mdash;never     taste.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Those hours of opium happiness which the Doctor and I spent     together in secret were regulated with a scientific accuracy.     We did not blindly smoke the drug of paradise, and leave our     dreams to chance. While smoking, we carefully steered our     conversation through the brightest and calmest channels of     thought. We talked of the East, and endeavored to recall the     magical panorama of its glowing scenery. We criticized the most     sensuous poets,&mdash;those who painted life ruddy with health,     brimming with passion, happy in the possession of youth and     strength and beauty. If we talked of Shakespeare's     <i>Tempest</i>, we lingered over Ariel, and avoided Caliban.     Like the Guebers, we turned our faces to the East, and saw only     the sunny side of the world.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        This skillful coloring of our train of thought produced in     our subsequent visions a corresponding tone. The splendors of     Arabian fairyland dyed our dreams. We paced the narrow strip of     grass with the tread and port of kings. The song of the     <i>rana arborea</i>, while he clung to the bark of the ragged     plum-tree, sounded like the strains of divine musicians.     Houses, walls, and streets melted like rain clouds, and vistas     of unimaginable glory stretched away before us. It was a     rapturous companionship. We enjoyed the vast delight more     perfectly because, even in our most ecstatic moments, we were     conscious of each other's presence. Our pleasures, while     individual, were still twin, vibrating and moving in musical     accord.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        On the evening in question, the tenth of July, the Doctor     and myself drifted into an unusually metaphysical mood. We lit     our large meerschaums, filled with fine Turkish tobacco, in the     core of which burned a little black nut of opium, that, like     the nut in the fairy tale, held within its narrow limits     wonders beyond the reach of kings; we paced to and fro,     conversing. A strange perversity dominated the currents of our     thought. They would <i>not</i> flow through the sun-lit     channels into which we strove to divert them. For some     unaccountable reason, they constantly diverged into dark and     lonesome beds, where a continual gloom brooded. It was in vain     that, after our old fashion, we flung ourselves on the shores     of the East, and talked of its gay bazaars, of the splendors of     the time of Haroun, of harems and golden palaces. Black afreets     continually arose from the depths of our talk, and expanded,     like the one the fisherman released from the copper vessel,     until they blotted everything bright from our vision.     Insensibly, we yielded to the occult force that swayed us, and     indulged in gloomy speculation. We had talked some time upon     the proneness of the human mind to mysticism, and the almost     universal love of the terrible, when Hammond suddenly said to     me. "What do you consider to be the greatest element of     terror?"</p></div>

			<div class="pagers" id="5"><a href="WhatWas843.shtml.html#4"><b>&lt;</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="WhatWas843.shtml.html#5">5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="WhatWas843.shtml.html#6"><b>&gt;</b></a></div>
			
			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The question puzzled me. That many things were terrible, I     knew. Stumbling over a corpse in the dark; beholding, as I once     did, a woman floating down a deep and rapid river, with wildly     lifted arms, and awful, upturned face, uttering, as she     drifted, shrieks that rent one's heart while we, spectators,     stood frozen at a window which overhung the river at a height     of sixty feet, unable to make the slightest effort to save her,     but dumbly watching her last supreme agony and her     disappearance. A shattered wreck, with no life visible,     encountered floating listlessly on the ocean, is a terrible     object, for it suggests a huge terror, the proportions of which     are veiled. But it now struck me, for the first time, that     there must be one great and ruling embodiment of fear,&mdash;a     King of Terrors, to which all others must succumb. What might     it be? To what train of circumstances would it owe its     existence?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I confess, Hammond," I replied to my friend, "I never     considered the subject before. That there must be one Something     more terrible than any other thing, I feel. I cannot attempt,     however, even the most vague definition."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I am somewhat like you, Harry," he answered. "I feel my     capacity to experience a terror greater than anything yet     conceived by the human mind;&mdash;something combining in     fearful and unnatural amalgamation hitherto supposed     incompatible elements. The calling of the voices in Brockden     Brown's novel of <i>Wieland</i> is awful; so is the picture     of the Dweller of the Threshold, in Bulwer's <i>Zanoni</i>;     but," he added, shaking his head gloomily, "there is something     more horrible still than those."</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Look here, Hammond," I rejoined, "let us drop this kind of     talk, for Heaven's sake! We shall suffer for it, depend on     it."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I don't know what's the matter with me to-night," he     replied, "but my brain is running upon all sorts of weird and     awful thoughts. I feel as if I could write a story like     Hoffman, to-night, if I were only master of a literary     style."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Well, if we are going to be Hoffmanesque in our talk, I'm     off to bed. Opium and nightmares should never be brought     together. How sultry it is! Good-night, Hammond."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Good-night, Harry. Pleasant dreams to you."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "To you, gloomy wretch, afreets, ghouls, and     enchanters."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        We parted, and each sought his respective chamber. I     undressed quickly and got into bed, taking with me, according     to my usual custom, a book, over which I generally read myself     to sleep. I opened the volume as soon as I had laid my head     upon the pillow, and instantly flung it to the other side of     the room. It was Goudon's <i>History of Monsters</i>,&mdash;a     curious French work, which I had lately imported from Paris,     but which, in the state of mind I had then reached, was     anything but an agreeable companion. I resolved to go to sleep     at once; so, turning down my gas until nothing but a little     blue point of light glimmered on the top of the tube, I     composed myself to rest.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The room was in total darkness. The atom of gas that still     remained alight did not illuminate a distance of three inches     round the burner. I desperately drew my arm across my eyes, as     if to shut out even the darkness, and tried to think of     nothing. It was in vain. The confounded themes touched on by     Hammond in the garden kept obtruding themselves on my brain. I     battled against them. I erected ramparts of would-be blackness     of intellect to keep them out. They still crowded upon me.     While I was lying still as a corpse, hoping that by a perfect     physical inaction I should hasten mental repose, an awful     incident occurred. A Something dropped, as it seemed, from the     ceiling, plumb upon my chest, and the next instant I felt two     bony hands encircling my throat, endeavoring to choke me.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I am no coward, and am possessed of considerable physical     strength. The suddenness of the attack, instead of stunning me,     strung every nerve to its highest tension. My body acted from     instinct, before my brain had time to realize the terrors of my     position. In an instant I wound two muscular arms around the     creature, and squeezed it, with all the strength of despair,     against my chest. In a few seconds the bony hands that had     fastened on my throat loosened their hold, and I was free to     breathe once more. Then commenced a struggle of awful     intensity. Immersed in the most profound darkness, totally     ignorant of the nature of the Thing by which I was so suddenly     attacked, finding my grasp slipping every moment, by reason, it     seemed to me, of the entire nakedness of my assailant, bitten     with sharp teeth in the shoulder, neck, and chest, having every     moment to protect my throat against a pair of sinewy, agile     hands, which my utmost efforts could not confine,&mdash;these     were a combination of circumstances to combat which required     all the strength, skill, and courage that I possessed.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        At last, after a silent, deadly, exhausting struggle, I got     my assailant under by a series of incredible efforts of     strength. Once pinned, with my knee on what I made out to be     its chest, I knew that I was victor. I rested for a moment to     breathe. I heard the creature beneath me panting in the     darkness, and felt the violent throbbing of a heart. It was     apparently as exhausted as I was; that was one comfort. At this     moment I remembered that I usually placed under my pillow,     before going to bed, a large yellow silk pocket handkerchief. I     felt for it instantly; it was there. In a few seconds more I     had, after a fashion, pinioned the creature's arms.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I now felt tolerably secure. There was nothing more to be     done but to turn on the gas, and, having first seen what my     midnight assailant was like, arouse the household. I will     confess to being actuated by a certain pride in not giving the     alarm before; I wished to make the capture alone and     unaided.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Never losing my hold for an instant, I slipped from the bed     to the floor, dragging my captive with me. I had but a few     steps to make to reach the gas-burner; these I made with the     greatest caution, holding the creature in a grip like a vice.     At last I got within arm's length of the tiny speck of blue     light which told me where the gas-burner lay. Quick as     lightning I released my grasp with one hand and let on the full     flood of light. Then I turned to look at my captive.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I cannot even attempt to give any definition of my     sensations the instant after I turned on the gas. I suppose I     must have shrieked with terror, for in less than a minute     afterward my room was crowded with the inmates of the house. I     shudder now as I think of that awful moment. <i>I saw     nothing</i>! Yes; I had one arm firmly clasped round a     breathing, panting, corporeal shape, my other hand gripped with     all its strength a throat as warm, as apparently fleshy, as my     own; and yet, with this living substance in my grasp, with its     body pressed against my own, and all in the bright glare of a     large jet of gas, I absolutely beheld nothing! Not even an     outline,&mdash;a vapor!</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I do not, even at this hour, realize the situation in which     I found myself. I cannot recall the astounding incident     thoroughly. Imagination in vain tries to compass the awful     paradox.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        It breathed. I felt its warm breath upon my cheek. It     struggled fiercely. It had hands. They clutched me. Its skin     was smooth, like my own. There it lay, pressed close up against     me, solid as stone,&mdash;and yet utterly invisible!</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I wonder that I did not faint or go mad on the instant. Some     wonderful instinct must have sustained me; for, absolutely, in     place of loosening my hold on the terrible Enigma, I seemed to     gain an additional strength in my moment of horror, and     tightened my grasp with such wonderful force that I felt the     creature shivering with agony.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Just then Hammond entered my room at the head of the     household. As soon as he beheld my face&mdash;which, I suppose,     must have been an awful sight to look at&mdash;he hastened     forward, crying, "Great heaven, Harry! what has happened?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Hammond! Hammond!" I cried, "come here. O, this is awful! I     have been attacked in bed by something or other, which I have     hold of; but I can't see it,&mdash;I can't see it!"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Hammond, doubtless struck by the unfeigned horror expressed     in my countenance, made one or two steps forward with an     anxious yet puzzled expression. A very audible titter burst     from the remainder of my visitors. This suppressed laughter     made me furious. To laugh at a human being in my position! It     was the worst species of cruelty. <i>Now</i>, I can     understand why the appearance of a man struggling violently, as     it would seem, with an airy nothing, and calling for assistance     against a vision, should have appeared ludicrous.     <i>Then</i>, so great was my rage against the mocking crowd     that had I the power I would have stricken them dead where they     stood.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Hammond! Hammond!" I cried again, despairingly, "for God's     sake come to me. I can hold the&mdash;the thing but a short     while longer. It is overpowering me. Help me! Help me!"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Harry," whispered Hammond, approaching me, "you have been     smoking too much opium."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I swear to you, Hammond, that this is no vision," I     answered, in the same low tone. "Don't you see how it shakes my     whole frame with its struggles? If you don't believe me,     convince yourself. Feel it,&mdash;touch it."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Hammond advanced and laid his hand in the spot I indicated.     A wild cry of horror burst from him. He had felt it!</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        In a moment he had discovered somewhere in my room a long     piece of cord, and was the next instant winding it and knotting     it about the body of the unseen being that I clasped in my     arms.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Harry," he said, in a hoarse, agitated voice, for, though     he preserved his presence of mind, he was deeply moved, "Harry,     it's all safe now. You may let go, old fellow, if you're tired.     The Thing can't move."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I was utterly exhausted, and I gladly loosed my hold.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Hammond stood holding the ends of the cord that bound the     Invisible, twisted round his hand, while before him,     self-supporting as it were, he beheld a rope laced and     interlaced, and stretching tightly around a vacant space. I     never saw a man look so thoroughly stricken with awe.     Nevertheless his face expressed all the courage and     determination which I knew him to possess. His lips, although     white, were set firmly, and one could perceive at a glance     that, although stricken with fear, he was not daunted.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The confusion that ensued among the guests of the house who     were witnesses of this extraordinary scene between Hammond and     myself,&mdash;who beheld the pantomime of binding this     struggling Something,&mdash;who beheld me almost sinking from     physical exhaustion when my task of jailer was over,&mdash;the     confusion and terror that took possession of the bystanders,     when they saw all this, was beyond description. The weaker ones     fled from the apartment. The few who remained clustered near     the door and could not be induced to approach Hammond and his     Charge. Still incredulity broke out through their terror. They     had not the courage to satisfy themselves, and yet they     doubted. It was in vain that I begged of some of the men to     come near and convince themselves by touch of the existence in     that room of a living being which was invisible. They were     incredulous, but did not dare to undeceive themselves. How     could a solid, living, breathing body be invisible, they asked.     My reply was this. I gave a sign to Hammond, and both of     us&mdash;conquering our fearful repugnance to touch the     invisible creature&mdash;lifted it from the ground, manacled as     it was, and took it to my bed. Its weight was about that of a     boy of fourteen.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Now my friends," I said, as Hammond and myself held the     creature suspended over the bed, "I can give you self-evident     proof that here is a solid, ponderable body, which,     nevertheless, you cannot see. Be good enough to watch the     surface of the bed attentively."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I was astonished at my own courage in treating this strange     event so calmly; but I had recovered from my first terror, and     felt a sort of scientific pride in the affair, which dominated     every other feeling.</p></div>

			<div class="pagers" id="12"><a href="WhatWas843.shtml.html#11"><b>&lt;</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="WhatWas843.shtml.html#12">12</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="WhatWas843.shtml.html#13"><b>&gt;</b></a></div>
			
			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The eyes of the bystanders were immediately fixed on my bed.     At a given signal Hammond and I let the creature fall. There     was a dull sound of a heavy body alighting on a soft mass. The     timbers of the bed creaked. A deep impression marked itself     distinctly on the pillow, and on the bed itself. The crowd who     witnessed this gave a low cry, and rushed from the room.     Hammond and I were left alone with our Mystery.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        We remained silent for some time, listening to the low,     irregular breathing of the creature on the bed, and watching     the rustle of the bedclothes as it impotently struggled to free     itself from confinement. Then Hammond spoke.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Harry, this is awful."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Ay, awful."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "But not unaccountable."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Not unaccountable! What do you mean? Such a thing has never     occurred since the birth of the world. I know not what to     think, Hammond. God grant that I am not mad, and that this is     not an insane fantasy!"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Let us reason a little, Harry. Here is a solid body which     we touch, but which we cannot see. The fact is so unusual that     it strikes us with terror. Is there no parallel, though, for     such a phenomenon? Take a piece of pure glass. It is tangible     and transparent. A certain chemical coarseness is all that     prevents its being so entirely transparent as to be totally     invisible. It is not <i>theoretically impossible</i>, mind     you, to make a glass which shall not reflect a single ray of     light,&mdash;a glass so pure and homogeneous in its atoms that     the rays from the sun will pass through it as they do through     the air, refracted but not reflected. We do not see the air,     and yet we feel it."</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "That's all very well, Hammond, but these are inanimate     substances. Glass does not breathe, air does not breathe.     <i>This</i> thing has a heart that palpitates,&mdash;a will     that moves it,&mdash;lungs that play, and inspire and     respire."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "You forget the phenomena of which we have so often heard of     late," answered the Doctor, gravely. "At the meetings called     'spirit circles,' invisible hands have been thrust into the     hands of those persons round the table,&mdash;warm, fleshly     hands that seemed to pulsate with mortal life."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "What? Do you think, then, that this thing     is&mdash;&mdash;"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I don't know what it is," was the solemn reply; "but please     the gods I will, with your assistance, thoroughly investigate     it."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        We watched together, smoking many pipes, all night long, by     the bedside of the unearthly being that tossed and panted until     it was apparently wearied out. Then we learned by the low,     regular breathing that it slept.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The next morning the house was all astir. The boarders     congregated on the landing outside my room, and Hammond and     myself were lions. We had to answer a thousand questions as to     the state of our extraordinary prisoner, for as yet not one     person in the house except ourselves could be I induced to set     foot in the apartment.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The creature was awake. This was evidenced by the convulsive     manner in which the bedclothes were moved in its efforts to     escape. There was something truly terrible in beholding, as it     were, those second-hand indications of the terrible writhings     and agonized struggles for liberty which themselves were     invisible.</p></div>

			<div class="pagers" id="14"><a href="WhatWas843.shtml.html#13"><b>&lt;</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="WhatWas843.shtml.html#14">14</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="WhatWas843.shtml.html#15"><b>&gt;</b></a></div>
			
			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Hammond and myself had racked our brains during the long     night to discover some means by which we might realize the     shape and general appearance of the Enigma. As well as we could     make out by passing our hands over the creature's form, its     outlines and lineaments were human. There was a mouth; a round,     smooth head without hair; a nose, which, however, was little     elevated above the cheeks; and its hands and feet felt like     those of a boy. At first we thought of placing the being on a     smooth surface and tracing its outlines with chalk, as     shoemakers trace the outline of the foot. This plan was given     up as being of no value. Such an outline would give not the     slightest idea of its conformation.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        A happy thought struck me. We would take a cast of it in     plaster of Paris. This would give us the solid figure, and     satisfy all our wishes. But how to do it? The movements of the     creature would disturb the setting of the plastic covering, and     distort the mold. Another thought. Why not give it chloroform?     It had respiratory organs,&mdash;that was evident by its     breathing. Once reduced to a state of insensibility, we could     do with it what we would. Doctor X&mdash;&mdash; was sent for;     and after the worthy physician had recovered from the first     shock of amazement, he proceeded to administer the chloroform.     In three minutes afterward we were enabled to remove the     fetters from the creature's body, and a modeler was busily     engaged in covering the invisible form with the moist clay. In     five minutes more we had a mold, and before evening a rough     facsimile of the Mystery. It was shaped like a     man&mdash;distorted, uncouth, and horrible, but still a man. It     was small, not over four feet and some inches in height, and     its limbs revealed a muscular development that was     unparalleled. Its face surpassed in hideousness anything I had     ever seen. Gustav Dor&eacute;, or Callot, or Tony Johannot,     never conceived anything so horrible. There is a face in one of     the latter's illustrations to <i>Un Voyage o&ugrave; il vous     plaira</i>, which somewhat approaches the countenance of this     creature, but does not equal it. It was the physiognomy of what     I should fancy a ghoul might be. It looked as if it was capable     of feeding on human flesh.</p></div>

			<div class="pagers" id="15"><a href="WhatWas843.shtml.html#14"><b>&lt;</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="WhatWas843.shtml.html#15">15</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="WhatWas843.shtml.html#16"><b>&gt;</b></a></div>
			
			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Having satisfied our curiosity, and bound every one in the     house to secrecy, it became a question what was to be done with     our Enigma? It was impossible that we should keep such a horror     in our house; it was equally impossible that such an awful     being should be let loose upon the world. I confess that I     would have gladly voted for the creature's destruction. But who     would shoulder the responsibility? Who would undertake the     execution of this horrible semblance of a human being? Day     after day this question was deliberated gravely. The boarders     all left the house. Mrs. Moffat was in despair, and threatened     Hammond and myself with all sorts of legal penalties if we did     not remove the Horror. Our answer was, "We will go if you like,     but we decline taking this creature with us. Remove it yourself     if you please. It appeared in your house. On you the     responsibility rests." To this there was, of course, no answer.     Mrs. Moffat could not obtain for love or money a person who     would even approach the Mystery.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The most singular part of the affair was that we were     entirely ignorant of what the creature habitually fed on.     Everything in the way of nutriment that we could think of was     placed before it, but was never touched. It was awful to stand     by, day after day, and see the clothes toss, and hear the hard     breathing, and know that it was starving.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Ten, twelve days, a fortnight passed, and it still lived.     The pulsations of the heart, however, were daily growing     fainter, and had now nearly ceased. It was evident that the     creature was dying for want of sustenance. While this terrible     life-struggle was going on, I felt miserable. I could not     sleep. Horrible as the creature was, it was pitiful to think of     the pangs it was suffering.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        At last it died. Hammond and I found it cold and stiff one     morning in the bed. The heart had ceased to beat, the lungs to     inspire. We hastened to bury it in the garden. It was a strange     funeral, the dropping of that viewless corpse into the damp     hole. The cast of its form I gave to Doctor X&mdash;&mdash;,     who keeps it in his museum in Tenth Street.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        As I am on the eve of a long journey from which I may not     return, I have drawn up this narrative of an event the most     singular that has ever come to my knowledge.</div>
