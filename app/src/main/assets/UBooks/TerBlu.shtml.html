<div class="story_text" id="1"><p>The following narrative was found among the papers of Dr. James  Hardcastle, who died of phthisis on February 4th, 1908, at 36,  Upper Coventry Flats, South Kensington.  Those who knew him best,  while refusing to express an opinion upon this particular  statement, are unanimous in asserting that he was a man of a sober  and scientific turn of mind, absolutely devoid of imagination, and  most unlikely to invent any abnormal series of events.  The paper  was contained in an envelope, which was docketed, "A Short Account  of the Circumstances which occurred near Miss Allerton's Farm in  North-West Derbyshire in the Spring of Last Year."  The envelope  was sealed, and on the other side was written in pencil -</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote>DEAR SEATON, -  <BR>       "It may interest, and perhaps pain you, to know that the  incredulity with which you met my story has prevented me from ever  opening my mouth upon the subject again.  I leave this record after  my death, and perhaps strangers may be found to have more  confidence in me than my friend."</blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inquiry has failed to elicit who this Seaton may have been.  I  may add that the visit of the deceased to Allerton's Farm, and the  general nature of the alarm there, apart from his particular  explanation, have been absolutely established.  With this foreword  I append his account exactly as he left it.  It is in the form of  a diary, some entries in which have been expanded, while a few have  been erased. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>April 17. - Already I feel the benefit of this wonderful  upland air.  The farm of the Allertons lies fourteen hundred and  twenty feet above sea-level, so it may well be a bracing climate.   Beyond the usual morning cough I have very little discomfort, and,  what with the fresh milk and the home-grown mutton, I have  every chance of putting on weight.  I think Saunderson will be  pleased. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The two Miss Allertons are charmingly quaint and kind, two dear  little hard-working old maids, who are ready to lavish all the  heart which might have gone out to husband and to children upon an  invalid stranger.  Truly, the old maid is a most useful person, one  of the reserve forces of the community.  They talk of the  superfluous woman, but what would the poor superfluous man do  without her kindly presence?  By the way, in their simplicity they  very quickly let out the reason why Saunderson recommended their  farm.  The Professor rose from the ranks himself, and I believe  that in his youth he was not above scaring crows in these very  fields. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        It is a most lonely spot, and the walks are picturesque in the  extreme.  The farm consists of grazing land lying at the bottom of  an irregular valley.  On each side are the fantastic limestone  hills, formed of rock so soft that you can break it away with your  hands.  All this country is hollow.  Could you strike it with some  gigantic hammer it would boom like a drum, or possibly cave in  altogether and expose some huge subterranean sea.  A great sea  there must surely be, for on all sides the streams run into the  mountain itself, never to reappear.  There are gaps everywhere amid  the rocks, and when you pass through them you find yourself in  great caverns, which wind down into the bowels of the earth.  I  have a small bicycle lamp, and it is a perpetual joy to me to carry  it into these weird solitudes, and to see the wonderful silver and  black effect when I throw its light upon the stalactites which  drape the lofty roofs.  Shut off the lamp, and you are in the  blackest darkness.  Turn it on, and it is a scene from the Arabian  Nights. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        But there is one of these strange openings in the earth which  has a special interest, for it is the handiwork, not of nature, but  of man.  I had never heard of Blue John when I came to these parts.   It is the name given to a peculiar mineral of a beautiful purple  shade, which is only found at one or two places in the world.  It  is so rare that an ordinary vase of Blue John would be valued at a  great price.  The Romans, with that extraordinary instinct of  theirs, discovered that it was to be found in this valley, and sank  a horizontal shaft deep into the mountain side.  The opening of  their mine has been called Blue John Gap, a clean-cut arch in  the rock, the mouth all overgrown with bushes.  It is a goodly  passage which the Roman miners have cut, and it intersects some of  the great water-worn caves, so that if you enter Blue John Gap you  would do well to mark your steps and to have a good store of  candles, or you may never make your way back to the daylight again.   I have not yet gone deeply into it, but this very day I stood at  the mouth of the arched tunnel, and peering down into the black  recesses beyond, I vowed that when my health returned I would  devote some holiday to exploring those mysterious depths and  finding out for myself how far the Roman had penetrated into the  Derbyshire hills. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Strange how superstitious these countrymen are!  I should have  thought better of young Armitage, for he is a man of some education  and character, and a very fine fellow for his station in life.  I  was standing at the Blue John Gap when he came across the field to  me. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Well, doctor," said he, "you're not afraid, anyhow." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Afraid!" I answered.  "Afraid of what?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Of it," said he, with a jerk of his thumb towards the black  vault, "of the Terror that lives in the Blue John Cave." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        How absurdly easy it is for a legend to arise in a lonely  countryside!  I examined him as to the reasons for his weird  belief.  It seems that from time to time sheep have been missing  from the fields, carried bodily away, according to Armitage.  That  they could have wandered away of their own accord and disappeared  among the mountains was an explanation to which he would not  listen.  On one occasion a pool of blood had been found, and some  tufts of wool.  That also, I pointed out, could be explained in a  perfectly natural way.  Further, the nights upon which sheep  disappeared were invariably very dark, cloudy nights with no moon.   This I met with the obvious retort that those were the nights which  a commonplace sheep-stealer would naturally choose for his work.   On one occasion a gap had been made in a wall, and some of  the stones scattered for a considerable distance.  Human agency  again, in my opinion.  Finally, Armitage clinched all his arguments  by telling me that he had actually heard the Creature - indeed, that  anyone could hear it who remained long enough at the Gap.  It was  a distant roaring of an immense volume.  I could not but smile  at this, knowing, as I do, the strange reverberations which come  out of an underground water system running amid the chasms of a  limestone formation.  My incredulity annoyed Armitage so that he  turned and left me with some abruptness. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And now comes the queer point about the whole business.  I was  still standing near the mouth of the cave turning over in my mind  the various statements of Armitage, and reflecting how readily they  could be explained away, when suddenly, from the depth of the  tunnel beside me, there issued a most extraordinary sound.  How  shall I describe it?  First of all, it seemed to be a great  distance away, far down in the bowels of the earth.  Secondly, in  spite of this suggestion of distance, it was very loud.  Lastly, it  was not a boom, nor a crash, such as one would associate with  falling water or tumbling rock, but it was a high whine, tremulous  and vibrating, almost like the whinnying of a horse.  It was  certainly a most remarkable experience, and one which for a moment,  I must admit, gave a new significance to Armitage's words.  I  waited by the Blue John Gap for half an hour or more, but there was  no return of the sound, so at last I wandered back to the  farmhouse, rather mystified by what had occurred.  Decidedly I  shall explore that cavern when my strength is restored.  Of course,  Armitage's explanation is too absurd for discussion, and yet that  sound was certainly very strange.  It still rings in my ears as I  write. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        April 20. - In the last three days I have made several  expeditions to the Blue John Gap, and have even penetrated some  short distance, but my bicycle lantern is so small and weak that I  dare not trust myself very far.  I shall do the thing more  systematically.  I have heard no sound at all, and could almost  believe that I had been the victim of some hallucination suggested,  perhaps, by Armitage's conversation.  Of course, the whole idea is  absurd, and yet I must confess that those bushes at the entrance of  the cave do present an appearance as if some heavy creature had  forced its way through them.  I begin to be keenly interested.  I  have said nothing to the Miss Allertons, for they are quite  superstitious enough already, but I have bought some candles, and  mean to investigate for myself. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I observed this morning that among the numerous tufts of  sheep's wool which lay among the bushes near the cavern there  was one which was smeared with blood.  Of course, my reason tells  me that if sheep wander into such rocky places they are likely to  injure themselves, and yet somehow that splash of crimson gave me  a sudden shock, and for a moment I found myself shrinking back in  horror from the old Roman arch.  A fetid breath seemed to ooze from  the black depths into which I peered.  Could it indeed be possible  that some nameless thing, some dreadful presence, was lurking down  yonder?  I should have been incapable of such feelings in the days  of my strength, but one grows more nervous and fanciful when one's  health is shaken. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        For the moment I weakened in my resolution, and was ready to  leave the secret of the old mine, if one exists, for ever unsolved.   But tonight my interest has returned and my nerves grown more  steady.  Tomorrow I trust that I shall have gone more deeply into  this matter. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        April 22. - Let me try and set down as accurately as I can  my extraordinary experience of yesterday.  I started in the  afternoon, and made my way to the Blue John Gap.  I confess that my  misgivings returned as I gazed into its depths, and I wished that  I had brought a companion to share my exploration.  Finally, with  a return of resolution, I lit my candle, pushed my way through the  briars, and descended into the rocky shaft. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        It went down at an acute angle for some fifty feet, the floor  being covered with broken stone.  Thence there extended a long,  straight passage cut in the solid rock.  I am no geologist, but the  lining of this corridor was certainly of some harder material than  limestone, for there were points where I could actually see the  tool-marks which the old miners had left in their excavation, as  fresh as if they had been done yesterday.  Down this strange, old-world corridor I stumbled, my feeble flame throwing a dim circle of  light around me, which made the shadows beyond the more threatening  and obscure.  Finally, I came to a spot where the Roman tunnel  opened into a water-worn cavern - a huge hall, hung with long white  icicles of lime deposit.  From this central chamber I could dimly  perceive that a number of passages worn by the subterranean streams  wound away into the depths of the earth.  I was standing there  wondering whether I had better return, or whether I dare venture  farther into this dangerous labyrinth, when my eyes fell upon  something at my feet which strongly arrested my attention. </p></div>

			<div class="pagers" id="6"><a href="TerBlu.shtml.html#5"><b>&lt;</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="TerBlu.shtml.html#6">6</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="TerBlu.shtml.html#7"><b>&gt;</b></a></div>
			
			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The greater part of the floor of the cavern was covered with  boulders of rock or with hard incrustations of lime, but at this  particular point there had been a drip from the distant roof, which  had left a patch of soft mud.  In the very centre of this there was  a huge mark - an ill-defined blotch, deep, broad and irregular, as  if a great boulder had fallen upon it.  No loose stone lay near,  however, nor was there anything to account for the impression.  It  was far too large to be caused by any possible animal, and besides,  there was only the one, and the patch of mud was of such a size  that no reasonable stride could have covered it.  As I rose from  the examination of that singular mark and then looked round into  the black shadows which hemmed me in, I must confess that I felt  for a moment a most unpleasant sinking of my heart, and that, do  what I could, the candle trembled in my outstretched hand. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I soon recovered my nerve, however, when I reflected how absurd  it was to associate so huge and shapeless a mark with the track of  any known animal.  Even an elephant could not have produced it.  I  determined, therefore, that I would not be scared by vague and  senseless fears from carrying out my exploration.  Before  proceeding, I took good note of a curious rock formation in the  wall by which I could recognize the entrance of the Roman tunnel.   The precaution was very necessary, for the great cave, so far as I  could see it, was intersected by passages.  Having made sure of my  position, and reassured myself by examining my spare candles and my  matches, I advanced slowly over the rocky and uneven surface of the  cavern. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And now I come to the point where I met with such sudden and  desperate disaster.  A stream, some twenty feet broad, ran across  my path, and I walked for some little distance along the bank to  find a spot where I could cross dry-shod.  Finally, I came to a  place where a single flat boulder lay near the centre, which I  could reach in a stride.  As it chanced, however, the rock had been  cut away and made top-heavy by the rush of the stream, so that  it tilted over as I landed on it and shot me into the ice-cold  water.  My candle went out, and I found myself floundering about in  utter and absolute darkness. </p></div>

			<div class="pagers" id="7"><a href="TerBlu.shtml.html#6"><b>&lt;</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="TerBlu.shtml.html#7">7</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="TerBlu.shtml.html#8"><b>&gt;</b></a></div>
			
			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I staggered to my feet again, more amused than alarmed by my  adventure.  The candle had fallen from my hand, and was lost in the  stream, but I had two others in my pocket, so that it was of no  importance.  I got one of them ready, and drew out my box of  matches to light it.  Only then did I realize my position.  The box  had been soaked in my fall into the river.  It was impossible to  strike the matches. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        A cold hand seemed to close round my heart as I realized my  position.  The darkness was opaque and horrible.  It was so utter, one put one's hand up to one's face as if to press off something  solid.  I stood still, and by an effort I steadied myself.  I tried  to reconstruct in my mind a map of the floor of the cavern as I had  last seen it.  Alas! the bearings which had impressed themselves  upon my mind were high on the wall, and not to be found by touch.   Still, I remembered in a general way how the sides were situated,  and I hoped that by groping my way along them I should at last come  to the opening of the Roman tunnel.  Moving very slowly, and  continually striking against the rocks, I set out on this desperate  quest. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        But I very soon realized how impossible it was.  In that black,  velvety darkness one lost all one's bearings in an instant.  Before  I had made a dozen paces, I was utterly bewildered as to my  whereabouts.  The rippling of the stream, which was the one sound  audible, showed me where it lay, but the moment that I left its  bank I was utterly lost.  The idea of finding my way back in  absolute darkness through that limestone labyrinth was clearly an  impossible one. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I sat down upon a boulder and reflected upon my unfortunate  plight.  I had not told anyone that I proposed to come to the Blue  John mine, and it was unlikely that a search party would come after  me.  Therefore I must trust to my own resources to get clear of the  danger.  There was only one hope, and that was that the matches  might dry.  When I fell into the river, only half of me had got  thoroughly wet.  My left shoulder had remained above the water.  I  took the box of matches, therefore, and put it into my left armpit.   The moist air of the cavern might possibly be counteracted by  the heat of my body, but even so, I knew that I could not hope to  get a light for many hours.  Meanwhile there was nothing for it but  to wait. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        By good luck I had slipped several biscuits into my pocket  before I left the farm-house.  These I now devoured, and washed  them down with a draught from that wretched stream which had been  the cause of all my misfortunes.  Then I felt about for a  comfortable seat among the rocks, and, having discovered a place  where I could get a support for my back, I stretched out my legs  and settled myself down to wait.  I was wretchedly damp and cold,  but I tried to cheer myself with the reflection that modern science  prescribed open windows and walks in all weather for my disease.   Gradually, lulled by the monotonous gurgle of the stream, and by  the absolute darkness, I sank into an uneasy slumber. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        How long this lasted I cannot say.  It may have been for an  hour, it may have been for several.  Suddenly I sat up on my rock  couch, with every nerve thrilling and every sense acutely on the  alert.  Beyond all doubt I had heard a sound - some sound very  distinct from the gurgling of the waters.  It had passed, but the  reverberation of it still lingered in my ear.  Was it a search  party?  They would most certainly have shouted, and vague as this  sound was which had wakened me, it was very distinct from the human  voice.  I sat palpitating and hardly daring to breathe.  There it  was again!  And again!  Now it had become continuous.  It was a  tread  - yes, surely it was the tread of some living creature.   But what a tread it was!  It gave one the impression of enormous  weight carried upon sponge-like feet, which gave forth a muffled  but ear-filling sound.  The darkness was as complete as ever, but  the tread was regular and decisive.  And it was coming beyond all  question in my direction. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        My skin grew cold, and my hair stood on end as I listened to  that steady and ponderous footfall.  There was some creature there,  and surely by the speed of its advance, it was one which could see  in the dark.  I crouched low on my rock and tried to blend myself  into it.  The steps grew nearer still, then stopped, and presently  I was aware of a loud lapping and gurgling.  The creature was  drinking at the stream.  Then again there was silence, broken by a  succession of long sniffs and snorts of tremendous volume and  energy.  Had it caught the scent of me?  My own nostrils were  filled by a low fetid odour, mephitic and abominable.  Then I heard  the steps again.  They were on my side of the stream now.  The  stones rattled within a few yards of where I lay.  Hardly daring to  breathe, I crouched upon my rock.  Then the steps drew away.  I  heard the splash as it returned across the river, and the sound  died away into the distance in the direction from which it had  come. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        For a long time I lay upon the rock, too much horrified to  move.  I thought of the sound which I had heard coming from the  depths of the cave, of Armitage's fears, of the strange impression  in the mud, and now came this final and absolute proof that there  was indeed some inconceivable monster, something utterly unearthly  and dreadful, which lurked in the hollow of the mountain.  Of its  nature or form I could frame no conception, save that it was both  light-footed and gigantic.  The combat between my reason, which  told me that such things could not be, and my senses, which told me  that they were, raged within me as I lay.  Finally, I was almost  ready to persuade myself that this experience had been part of some  evil dream, and that my abnormal condition might have conjured up  an hallucination.  But there remained one final experience which  removed the last possibility of doubt from my mind. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I had taken my matches from my armpit and felt them.  They  seemed perfectly hard and dry.  Stooping down into a crevice of the  rocks, I tried one of them.  To my delight it took fire at once.   I lit the candle, and, with a terrified backward glance into the  obscure depths of the cavern, I hurried in the direction of the  Roman passage.  As I did so I passed the patch of mud on which I  had seen the huge imprint.  Now I stood astonished before it, for  there were three similar imprints upon its surface, enormous in  size, irregular in outline, of a depth which indicated the  ponderous weight which had left them.  Then a great terror surged  over me.  Stooping and shading my candle with my hand, I ran in a  frenzy of fear to the rocky archway, hastened up it, and never  stopped until, with weary feet and panting lungs, I rushed up the  final slope of stones, broke through the tangle of briars, and  flung myself exhausted upon the soft grass under the peaceful light  of the stars.  It was three in the morning when I reached the farm-house, and today I am all unstrung and quivering after my  terrific adventure.  As yet I have told no one.  I must move warily  in the matter.  What would the poor lonely women, or the uneducated  yokels here think of it if I were to tell them my experience?  Let  me go to someone who can understand and advise. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        April 25. - I was laid up in bed for two days after my  incredible adventure in the cavern.  I use the adjective with a  very definite meaning, for I have had an experience since which has  shocked me almost as much as the other.  I have said that I was  looking round for someone who could advise me.  There is a Dr. Mark  Johnson who practices some few miles away, to whom I had a note of  recommendation from Professor Saunderson.  To him I drove,  when I was strong enough to get about, and I recounted to him my  whole strange experience.  He listened intently, and then carefully  examined me, paying special attention to my reflexes and to the  pupils of my eyes.  When he had finished, he refused to discuss my  adventure, saying that it was entirely beyond him, but he gave me  the card of a Mr. Picton at Castleton, with the advice that I  should instantly go to him and tell him the story exactly as I had  done to himself.  He was, according to my adviser, the very man who  was pre-eminently suited to help me.  I went on to the station,  therefore, and made my way to the little town, which is some ten  miles away.  Mr. Picton appeared to be a man of importance, as his  brass plate was displayed upon the door of a considerable building  on the outskirts of the town.  I was about to ring his bell, when  some misgiving came into my mind, and, crossing to a neighbouring  shop, I asked the man behind the counter if he could tell me  anything of Mr. Picton.  "Why," said he, "he is the best mad doctor  in Derbyshire, and yonder is his asylum."  You can imagine that it  was not long before I had shaken the dust of Castleton from my feet  and returned to the farm, cursing all unimaginative pedants who  cannot conceive that there may be things in creation which have  never yet chanced to come across their mole's vision.  After all,  now that I am cooler, I can afford to admit that I have been no  more sympathetic to Armitage than Dr. Johnson has been to me. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        April 27.  When I was a student I had the reputation of  being a man of courage and enterprise.  I remember that when there  was a ghost-hunt at Coltbridge it was I who sat up in the  haunted house.  Is it advancing years (after all, I am only thirty-five), or is it this physical malady which has caused degeneration?   Certainly my heart quails when I think of that horrible cavern in  the hill, and the certainty that it has some monstrous occupant.   What shall I do?  There is not an hour in the day that I do not  debate the question.  If I say nothing, then the mystery remains  unsolved.  If I do say anything, then I have the alternative of mad  alarm over the whole countryside, or of absolute incredulity which  may end in consigning me to an asylum.  On the whole, I think that  my best course is to wait, and to prepare for some expedition which  shall be more deliberate and better thought out than the last.  As  a first step I have been to Castleton and obtained a few  essentials - a large acetylene lantern for one thing, and a good  double-barrelled sporting rifle for another.  The latter I have  hired, but I have bought a dozen heavy game cartridges, which would  bring down a rhinoceros.  Now I am ready for my troglodyte friend.   Give me better health and a little spate of energy, and I shall try  conclusions with him yet.  But who and what is he?  Ah!  there is  the question which stands between me and my sleep.  How many  theories do I form, only to discard each in turn!  It is all so  utterly unthinkable.  And yet the cry, the footmark, the tread in  the cavern - no reasoning can get past these I think of the old-world legends of dragons and of other monsters.  Were they,  perhaps, not such fairy-tales as we have thought?  Can it be that  there is some fact which underlies them, and am I, of all mortals,  the one who is chosen to expose it? </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        May 3. - For several days I have been laid up by the  vagaries of an English spring, and during those days there have  been developments, the true and sinister meaning of which no one  can appreciate save myself.  I may say that we have had cloudy and  moonless nights of late, which according to my information were the  seasons upon which sheep disappeared.  Well, sheep have  disappeared.  Two of Miss Allerton's, one of old Pearson's of the  Cat Walk, and one of Mrs. Moulton's.  Four in all during three  nights.  No trace is left of them at all, and the countryside is  buzzing with rumours of gipsies and of sheep-stealers. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        But there is something more serious than that.  Young Armitage  has disappeared also.  He left his moorland cottage early on  Wednesday night and has never been heard of since.  He was an  unattached man, so there is less sensation than would otherwise be  the case.  The popular explanation is that he owes money, and has  found a situation in some other part of the country, whence he will  presently write for his belongings.  But I have grave misgivings.   Is it not much more likely that the recent tragedy of the sheep has  caused him to take some steps which may have ended in his own  destruction?  He may, for example, have lain in wait for the  creature and been carried off by it into the recesses of the  mountains.  What an inconceivable fate for a civilized Englishman  of the twentieth century!  And yet I feel that it is possible and  even probable.  But in that case, how far am I answerable both for  his death and for any other mishap which may occur?  Surely with  the knowledge I already possess it must be my duty to see that  something is done, or if necessary to do it myself.  It must be the  latter, for this morning I went down to the local police-station  and told my story.  The inspector entered it all in a large book  and bowed me out with commendable gravity, but I heard a burst of  laughter before I had got down his garden path.  No doubt he was  recounting my adventure to his family. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        June 10. - I am writing this, propped up in bed, six weeks  after my last entry in this journal.  I have gone through a  terrible shock both to mind and body, arising from such an  experience as has seldom befallen a human being before.  But I have  attained my end.  The danger from the Terror which dwells in the  Blue John Gap has passed never to return.  Thus much at least I, a  broken invalid, have done for the common good.  Let me now recount  what occurred as clearly as I may. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The night of Friday, May 3rd, was dark and cloudy - the very  night for the monster to walk.  About eleven o'clock I went from  the farm-house with my lantern and my rifle, having first left a  note upon the table of my bedroom in which I said that, if I were  missing, search should be made for me in the direction of the Gap.   I made my way to the mouth of the Roman shaft, and, having perched  myself among the rocks close to the opening, I shut off my lantern  and waited patiently with my loaded rifle ready to my hand. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        It was a melancholy vigil.  All down the winding valley I could  see the scattered lights of the farm-houses, and the church clock  of Chapel-le-Dale tolling the hours came faintly to my ears.   These tokens of my fellow-men served only to make my own position  seem the more lonely, and to call for a greater effort to overcome  the terror which tempted me continually to get back to the farm,  and abandon for ever this dangerous quest.  And yet there lies deep  in every man a rooted self-respect which makes it hard for him to  turn back from that which he has once undertaken.  This feeling of  personal pride was my salvation now, and it was that alone which  held me fast when every instinct of my nature was dragging me away.   I am glad now that I had the strength.  In spite of all that is has  cost me, my manhood is at least above reproach. </p></div>

			<div class="pagers" id="14"><a href="TerBlu.shtml.html#13"><b>&lt;</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="TerBlu.shtml.html#14">14</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="TerBlu.shtml.html#15"><b>&gt;</b></a></div>
			
			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Twelve o'clock struck in the distant church, then one, then  two.  It was the darkest hour of the night.  The clouds were  drifting low, and there was not a star in the sky.  An owl was  hooting somewhere among the rocks, but no other sound, save the  gentle sough of the wind, came to my ears.  And then suddenly I  heard it!  From far away down the tunnel came those muffled steps,  so soft and yet so ponderous.  I heard also the rattle of stones as  they gave way under that giant tread.  They drew nearer.  They were  close upon me.  I heard the crashing of the bushes round the  entrance, and then dimly through the darkness I was conscious of  the loom of some enormous shape, some monstrous inchoate creature,  passing swiftly and very silently out from the tunnel.  I was  paralysed with fear and amazement.  Long as I had waited, now that  it had actually come I was unprepared for the shock.  I lay  motionless and breathless, whilst the great dark mass whisked by me  and was swallowed up in the night. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        But now I nerved myself for its return.  No sound came from the  sleeping countryside to tell of the horror which was loose.  In no  way could I judge how far off it was, what it was doing, or when it  might be back.  But not a second time should my nerve fail me, not  a second time should it pass unchallenged.  I swore it between my  clenched teeth as I laid my cocked rifle across the rock. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And yet it nearly happened.  There was no warning of approach  now as the creature passed over the grass.  Suddenly, like a dark,  drifting shadow, the huge bulk loomed up once more before me,  making for the entrance of the cave.  Again came that paralysis of  volition which held my crooked forefinger impotent upon the  trigger.  But with a desperate effort I shook it off.  Even as the  brushwood rustled, and the monstrous beast blended with the shadow  of the Gap, I fired at the retreating form.  In the blaze of the  gun I caught a glimpse of a great shaggy mass, something with rough  and bristling hair of a withered grey colour, fading away to white  in its lower parts, the huge body supported upon short, thick,  curving legs.  I had just that glance, and then I heard the rattle  of the stones as the creature tore down into its burrow.  In an  instant, with a triumphant revulsion of feeling, I had cast my  fears to the wind, and uncovering my powerful lantern, with my  rifle in my hand, I sprang down from my rock and rushed after the  monster down the old Roman shaft. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        My splendid lamp cast a brilliant flood of vivid light in front  of me, very different from the yellow glimmer which had aided me  down the same passage only twelve days before.  As I ran, I saw the  great beast lurching along before me, its huge bulk filling up the  whole space from wall to wall.  Its hair looked like coarse faded  oakum, and hung down in long, dense masses which swayed as it  moved.  It was like an enormous unclipped sheep in its fleece, but  in size it was far larger than the largest elephant, and its  breadth seemed to be nearly as great as its height.  It fills me  with amazement now to think that I should have dared to follow such  a horror into the bowels of the earth, but when one's blood is up,  and when one's quarry seems to be flying, the old primeval hunting-spirit awakes and prudence is cast to the wind.  Rifle in hand, I  ran at the top of my speed upon the trail of the monster. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I had seen that the creature was swift.  Now I was to find out  to my cost that it was also very cunning.  I had imagined that it  was in panic flight, and that I had only to pursue it.  The idea  that it might turn upon me never entered my excited brain.  I have  already explained that the passage down which I was racing opened  into a great central cave.  Into this I rushed, fearful lest I  should lose all trace of the beast.  But he had turned upon his own  traces, and in a moment we were face to face. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        That picture, seen in the brilliant white light of the lantern,  is etched for ever upon my brain.  He had reared up on his hind  legs as a bear would do, and stood above me, enormous, menacing - such a creature as no nightmare had ever brought to my imagination.   I have said that he reared like a bear, and there was something  bear-like - if one could conceive a bear which was ten-fold the bulk  of any bear seen upon earth - in his whole pose and attitude, in his  great crooked forelegs with their ivory-white claws, in his rugged  skin, and in his red, gaping mouth, fringed with monstrous fangs.   Only in one point did he differ from the bear, or from any other  creature which walks the earth, and even at that supreme moment a  shudder of horror passed over me as I observed that the eyes which  glistened in the glow of my lantern were huge, projecting bulbs,  white and sightless.  For a moment his great paws swung over my  head.  The next he fell forward upon me, I and my broken lantern  crashed to the earth, and I remember no more. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        When I came to myself I was back in the farm-house of the  Allertons.  Two days had passed since my terrible adventure in the  Blue John Gap.  It seems that I had lain all night in the cave  insensible from concussion of the brain, with my left arm and two  ribs badly fractured.  In the morning my note had been found, a  search party of a dozen farmers assembled, and I had been tracked  down and carried back to my bedroom, where I had lain in high  delirium ever since.  There was, it seems, no sign of the creature,  and no bloodstain which would show that my bullet had found him as  he passed.  Save for my own plight and the marks upon the mud,  there was nothing to prove that what I said was true. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Six weeks have now elapsed, and I am able to sit out once more  in the sunshine.  Just opposite me is the steep hillside, grey with  shaly rock, and yonder on its flank is the dark cleft which marks  the opening of the Blue John Gap.  But it is no longer a source of  terror.  Never again through that ill-omened tunnel shall any  strange shape flit out into the world of men.  The educated and the  scientific, the Dr. Johnsons and the like, may smile at my  narrative, but the poorer folk of the countryside had never a doubt  as to its truth.  On the day after my recovering consciousness  they assembled in their hundreds round the Blue John Gap.  As the  Castleton Courier said: </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "It was useless for our correspondent, or for any of the  adventurous gentlemen who had come from Matlock, Buxton, and other  parts, to offer to descend, to explore the cave to the end, and to  finally test the extraordinary narrative of Dr. James Hardcastle.   The country people had taken the matter into their own hands, and  from an early hour of the morning they had worked hard in stopping  up the entrance of the tunnel.  There is a sharp slope where the  shaft begins, and great boulders, rolled along by many willing  hands, were thrust down it until the Gap was absolutely sealed.  So  ends the episode which has caused such excitement throughout the  country.  Local opinion is fiercely divided upon the subject.  On  the one hand are those who point to Dr. Hardcastle's impaired  health, and to the possibility of cerebral lesions of tubercular  origin giving rise to strange hallucinations.  Some idee fixe,  according to these gentlemen, caused the doctor to wander down the  tunnel, and a fall among the rocks was sufficient to account for  his injuries.  On the other hand, a legend of a strange creature in  the Gap has existed for some months back, and the farmers look upon  Dr. Hardcastle's narrative and his personal injuries as a final  corroboration.  So the matter stands, and so the matter will  continue to stand, for no definite solution seems to us to be now  possible.  It transcends human wit to give any scientific  explanation which could cover the alleged facts." </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Perhaps before the Courier published these words they would  have been wise to send their representative to me.  I have thought  the matter out, as no one else has occasion to do, and it is  possible that I might have removed some of the more obvious  difficulties of the narrative and brought it one degree nearer to  scientific acceptance.  Let me then write down the only explanation  which seems to me to elucidate what I know to my cost to have been  a series of facts.  My theory may seem to be wildly improbable, but  at least no one can venture to say that it is impossible. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        My view is - and it was formed, as is shown by my diary, before  my personal adventure - that in this part of England there is a  vast subterranean lake or sea, which is fed by the great number of  streams which pass down through the limestone.  Where there is a  large collection of water there must also be some evaporation,  mists or rain, and a possibility of vegetation.  This in turn  suggests that there may be animal life, arising, as the vegetable  life would also do, from those seeds and types which had been  introduced at an early period of the world's history, when  communication with the outer air was more easy.  This place had  then developed a fauna and flora of its own, including such  monsters as the one which I had seen, which may well have been the  old cave-bear, enormously enlarged and modified by its new  environment.  For countless aeons the internal and the external  creation had kept apart, growing steadily away from each other.   Then there had come some rift in the depths of the mountain which  had enabled one creature to wander up and, by means of the Roman  tunnel, to reach the open air.  Like all subterranean life, it had  lost the power of sight, but this had no doubt been compensated for  by nature in other directions.  Certainly it had some means of  finding its way about, and of hunting down the sheep upon the  hillside.  As to its choice of dark nights, it is part of my theory  that light was painful to those great white eyeballs, and that it  was only a pitch-black world which it could tolerate.  Perhaps,  indeed, it was the glare of my lantern which saved my life at that  awful moment when we were face to face.  So I read the riddle.  I  leave these facts behind me, and if you can explain them, do so; or  if you choose to doubt them, do so.  Neither your belief nor your  incredulity can alter them, nor affect one whose task is nearly  over. </p></div>
