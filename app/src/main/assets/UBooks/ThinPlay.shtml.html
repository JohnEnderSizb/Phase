<div class="story_text" id="1"><p>Being acquainted with a newspaper reporter who had a couple of  free passes, I got to see the performance a few nights ago at one of  the popular vaudeville houses. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        One of the numbers was a violin solo by a striking-looking man  not much past forty, but with very gray thick hair.  Not being  afflicted with a taste for music, I let the system of noises drift past  my ears while I regarded the man. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "There was a story about that chap a month or two ago," said the  reporter.  "They gave me the assignment.  It was to run a column  and was to be on the extremely light and joking order.  The old  man seems to like the funny touch I give to local happenings.  Oh,  yes, I'm working on a farce comedy now.  Well, I went down to the  house and got all the details; but I certainly fell down on that job.   I went back and turned in a comic write-up of an east side funeral  instead.  Why?  Oh, I couldn't seem to get hold of it with my funny  hooks, somehow.  Maybe you could make a one-act tragedy out of  it for a curtain-raiser.  I'll give you the details." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        After the performance my friend, the reporter, recited to me the  facts over Wurzburger. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I see no reason," said I, when he had concluded, "why that  shouldn't make a rattling good funny story.  Those three people  couldn't have acted in a more absurd and preposterous manner if  they had been real actors in a real theatre.  I'm really afraid that all  the stage is a world, anyhow, and all the players men and women.  'The thing's the play,' is the way I quote Mr. Shakespeare." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Try it," said the reporter. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I will," said I; and I did, to show him how he could have made a  humorous column of it for his paper. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        There stands a house near Abingdon Square.  On the ground floor  there has been for twenty-five years a little store where toys and  notions and stationery are sold. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        One night twenty years ago there was a wedding in the rooms  above the store.  The Widow Mayo owned the house and store.   Her daughter Helen was married to Frank Barry.  John Delaney  was best man.  Helen was eighteen, and her picture had been  printed in a morning paper next to the headlines of a "Wholesale  Female Murderess" story from Butte, Mont.  But after your eye  and intelligence had rejected the connection, you seized your  magnifying glass and read beneath the portrait her description as  one of a series of Prominent Beauties and Belles of the lower west  side. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Frank Barry and John Delaney were "prominent" young beaux of  the same side, and bosom friends, whom you expected to turn  upon each other every time the curtain went up.  One who pays his  money for orchestra seats and fiction expects this.  That is the first  funny idea that has turned up in the story yet.  Both had made a  great race for Helen's hand.  When Frank won, John shook his  hand and congratulated him - honestly, he did. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        After the ceremony Helen ran upstairs to put on her hat.  She was  getting married in a traveling dress.  She and Frank were going to  Old Point Comfort for a week.  Downstairs the usual horde of  gibbering cave-dwellers were waiting with their hands full of old  Congress gaiters and paper bags of hominy. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Then there was a rattle of the fire-escape, and into her room jumps  the mad and infatuated John Delaney, with a damp curl drooping  upon his forehead, and made violent and reprehensible love to his  lost one, entreating her to flee or fly with him to the Riviera, or the  Bronx, or any old place where there are Italian skies and <i>dolce far  niente</i>. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        It would have carried Blaney off his feet to see Helen repulse him.   With blazing and scornful eyes she fairly withered him by  demanding whatever he meant by speaking to respectable people  that way. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        In a few moments she had him going.  The manliness that had  possessed him departed.  He bowed low, and said something about  "irresistible impulse" and "forever carry in his heart the memory  of" - and she suggested that he catch the first fire-escape going  down. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I will away," said John Delaney, "to the furthermost parts of the  earth.  I cannot remain near you and know that you are another's.  I  will to Africa, and there amid other scenes strive to for -" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "For goodness sake, get out," said Helen.  "Somebody might come  in." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He knelt upon one knee, and she extended him one white hand that  he might give it a farewell kiss. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Girls, was this choice boon of the great little god Cupid ever  vouchsafed you - to have the fellow you want hard and fast, and  have the one you don't want come with a damp curl on his  forehead and kneel to you and babble of Africa and love which, in  spite of everything, shall forever bloom, an amaranth, in his heart?   To know your power, and to feel the sweet security of your own  happy state; to send the unlucky one, broken-hearted, to foreign  climes, while you congratulate yourself as he presses his last kiss  upon your knuckles, that your nails are well manicured - say, girls,  it's galluptious - don't ever let it get by you. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And then, of course - how did you guess it? - the door opened and  in stalked the bridegroom, jealous of slow-tying bonnet strings. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The farewell kiss was imprinted upon Helen's hand, and out of the  window and down the fire-escape sprang John Delaney, Africa  bound. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        A little slow music, if you please - faint violin, just a breath in the  clarinet and a touch of the 'cello.  Imagine the scene.  Frank,  white-hot, with the cry of a man wounded to death bursting from  him.  Helen, rushing and clinging to him, trying to explain.  He  catches her wrists and tears them from his shoulders - once, twice,  thrice he sways her this way and that - the stage manager will show  you how - and throws her from him to the floor a huddled, crushed,  moaning thing.  Never, he cries, will he look upon her face again,  and rushes from the house through the staring groups of  astonished guests. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And, now because it is the Thing instead of the Play, the audience  must stroll out into the real lobby of the world and marry, die,  grow gray, rich, poor, happy or sad during the intermission of  twenty years which must precede the rising of the curtain again. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Mrs. Barry inherited the shop and the house.  At thirty-eight she  could have bested many an eighteen-year-old at a beauty show on  points and general results.  Only a few people remembered her  wedding comedy, but she made of it no secret.  She did not pack it  in lavender or moth balls, nor did she sell it to a magazine. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        One day a middle-aged money-making lawyer, who bought his  legal cap and ink of her, asked her across the counter to marry  him. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I'm really much obliged to you," said Helen, cheerfully, "but I  married another man twenty years ago.  He was more a goose than  a man, but I think I love him yet.  I have never seen him since  about half an hour after the ceremony.  Was it copying ink that  you wanted or just writing fluid?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The lawyer bowed over the counter with old-time grace and left a  respectful kiss on the back of her hand.  Helen sighed.  Parting  salutes, however romantic, may be overdone.  Here she was at  thirty-eight, beautiful and admired; and all that she seemed to have  got from her lovers were approaches and adieus.  Worse still, in  the last one she had lost a customer, too. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Business languished, and she hung out a Room to Let card.  Two  large rooms on the third floor were prepared for desirable tenants.   Roomers came, and went regretfully, for the house of Mrs. Barry  was the abode of neatness, comfort and taste. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        One day came Ramonti, the violinist, and engaged the front room  above.  The discord and clatter uptown offended his nice ear; so a  friend had sent him to this oasis in the desert of noise. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Ramonti, with his still youthful face, his dark eyebrows, his short,  pointed, foreign, brown beard, his distinguished head of gray hair,  and his artist's temperament - revealed in his light, gay and  sympathetic manner - was a welcome tenant in the old house near  Abingdon Square. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Helen lived on the floor above the store.  The architecture of it was  singular and quaint.  The hall was large and almost square.  Up  one side of it, and then across the end of it ascended an open  stairway to the floor above.  This hall space she had furnished as a  sitting room and office combined.  There she kept her desk and  wrote her business letters; and there she sat of evenings by a warm  fire and a bright red light and sewed or read.  Ramonti found the  atmosphere so agreeable that he spent much time there, describing  to Mrs. Barry the wonders of Paris, where he had studied with a  particularly notorious and noisy fiddler. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Next comes lodger No. 2, a handsome, melancholy man in the  early 40's, with a brown, mysterious beard, and strangely pleading,  haunting eyes.  He, too, found the society of Helen a desirable  thing.  With the eyes of Romeo and Othello's tongue, he charmed  her with tales of distant climes and wooed her by respectful  innuendo. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        From the first Helen felt a marvelous and compelling thrill in the  presence of this man.  His voice somehow took her swiftly back to  the days of her youth's romance.  This feeling grew, and she gave  way to it, and it led her to an instinctive belief that he had been a  factor in that romance.  And then with a woman's reasoning (oh,  yes, they do, sometimes) she leaped over common syllogism and  theory, and logic, and was sure that her husband had come back to  her.  For she saw in his eyes love, which no woman can mistake,  and a thousand tons of regret and remorse, which aroused pity,  which is perilously near to love requited, which is the <i>sine qua  non</i> in the house that Jack built. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        But she made no sign.  A husband who steps around the corner for  twenty years and then drops in again should not expect to find his  slippers laid out too conveniently near nor a match ready lighted  for his cigar.  There must be expiation, explanation, and possibly  execration.  A little purgatory, and then, maybe, if he were  properly humble, he might be trusted with a harp and crown.  And  so she made no sign that she knew or suspected. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And my friend, the reporter, could see nothing funny in this!  Sent  out on an assignment to write up a roaring, hilarious, brilliant  joshing story of - but I will not knock a brother - let us go on with  the story. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        One evening Ramonti stopped in Helen's hall-office-reception-room and told his love with the tenderness and ardor of the  enraptured artist.  His words were a bright flame of the divine fire  that glows in the heart of a man who is a dreamer and doer  combined. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "But before you give me an answer," he went on, before she could  accuse him of suddenness, "I must tell you that 'Ramonti' is the  only name I have to offer you.  My manager gave me that.  I do not  know who I am or where I came from.  My first recollection is of  opening my eyes in a hospital.  I was a young man, and I had been  there for weeks.  My life before that is a blank to me.  They told  me that I was found lying in the street with a wound on my head  and was brought there in an ambulance.  They thought I must have  fallen and struck my head upon the stones.  There was nothing to  show who I was.  I have never been able to remember.  After I was  discharged from the hospital, I took up the violin.  I have had  success.  Mrs. Barry - I do not know your name except that - I love  you; the first time I saw you I realized that you were the one  woman in the world for me - and" - oh, a lot of stuff like that. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Helen felt young again.  First a wave of pride and a sweet little  thrill of vanity went all over her; and then she looked Ramonti in  the eyes, and a tremendous throb went through her heart.  She  hadn't expected that throb.  It took her by surprise.  The musician  had become a big factor in her life, and she hadn't been aware of  it. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Mr. Ramonti," she said sorrowfully (this was not on the stage,  remember; it was in the old home near Abingdon Square), "I'm  awfully sorry, but I'm a married woman." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And then she told him the sad story of her life, as a heroine must  do, sooner or later, either to a theatrical manager or to a reporter. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Ramonti took her hand, bowed low and kissed it, and went up to  his room. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Helen sat down and looked mournfully at her hand.  Well she  might.  Three suitors had kissed it, mounted their red roan steeds  and ridden away. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        In an hour entered the mysterious stranger with the haunting eyes.   Helen was in the willow rocker, knitting a useless thing in cotton-wool.  He ricocheted from the stairs and stopped for a chat.   Sitting across the table from her, he also poured out his narrative  of love.  And then he said:  "Helen, do you not remember me?  I  think I have seen it in your eyes.  Can you forgive the past and  remember the love that has lasted for twenty years?  I wronged you  deeply - I was afraid to come back to you - but my love  overpowered my reason.  Can you, will you, forgive me?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Helen stood up.  The mysterious stranger held one of her hands in  a strong and trembling clasp. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        There she stood, and I pity the stage that it has not acquired a  scene like that and her emotions to portray. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        For she stood with a divided heart.  The fresh, unforgettable,  virginal love for her bridegroom was hers; the treasured, sacred,  honored memory of her first choice filled half her soul.  She leaned  to that pure feeling.  Honor and faith and sweet, abiding romance  bound her to it.  But the other half of her heart and soul was filled  with something else - a later, fuller, nearer influence.  And so the  old fought against the new. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And while she hesitated, from the room above came the soft,  racking, petitionary music of a violin.  The hag, music, bewitches  some of the noblest.  The daws may peck upon one's sleeve  without injury, but whoever wears his heart upon his tympanum  gets it not far from the neck. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        This music and the musician caller her, and at her side honor and  the old love held her back. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Forgive me," he pleaded. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Twenty years is a long time to remain away from the one you say  you love," she declared, with a purgatorial touch. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "How could I tell?" he begged.  "I will conceal nothing from you.   That night when he left I followed him.  I was mad with jealousy.   On a dark street I struck him down.  He did not rise.  I examined  him.  His head had struck a stone.  I did not intend to kill him.   I was mad with love and jealousy.  I hid near by and saw an  ambulance take him away.  Although you married him, Helen -" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "<i>Who are you?</i>" cried the woman, with wide-open eyes,  snatching her hand away. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Don't you remember me, Helen - the one who has always loved  you best?  I am John Delaney.  If you can forgive -" </p></div>

Frank!  Frank!" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Three mortals thus juggling with years as though they were billiard  balls, and my friend, the reporter, couldn't see anything funny in it!</div>
