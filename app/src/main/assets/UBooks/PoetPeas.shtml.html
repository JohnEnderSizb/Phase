<div class="story_text" id="1"><p>The other day a poet friend of mine, who has lived in close  communion with nature all his life, wrote a poem and took it to an  editor. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        It was a living pastoral, full of the genuine breath of the fields, the  song of birds, and the pleasant chatter of trickling streams. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        When the poet called again to see about it, with hopes of a  beefsteak dinner in his heart, it was handed back to him with the  comment: </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Too artificial." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Several of us met over spaghetti and Dutchess County chianti, and  swallowed indignation with slippery forkfuls. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And there we dug a pit for the editor.  With us was Conant, a well-arrived writer of fiction - a man who had trod on asphalt all his life,  and who had never looked upon bucolic scenes except with  sensations of disgust from the windows of express trains. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Conant wrote a poem and called it "The Doe and the Brook."  It  was a fine specimen of the kind of work you would expect from a  poet who had strayed with Amaryllis only as far as the florist's  windows, and whose sole ornithological discussion had been  carried on with a waiter.  Conant signed this poem, and we sent it  to the same editor. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        But this has very little to do with the story. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Just as the editor was reading the first line of the poem, on the next  morning, a being stumbled off the West Shore ferryboat, and loped  slowly up Forty-second Street. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The invader was a young man with light blue eyes, a hanging lip  and hair the exact color of the little orphan's (afterward discovered  to be the earl's daughter) in one of Mr. Blaney's plays.  His  trousers were corduroy, his coat short-sleeved, with buttons in the  middle of his back.  One bootleg was outside the corduroys.  You  looked expectantly, though in vain, at his straw hat for ear holes,  its shape inaugurating the suspicion that it had been ravaged from  a former equine possessor.  In his hand was a valise - description of  it is an impossible task; a Boston man would not have carried his  lunch and law books to his office in it.  And above one ear, in his  hair, was a wisp of hay - the rustic's letter of credit, his badge of  innocence, the last clinging touch of the Garden of Eden lingering  to shame the gold-brick men. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Knowingly, smilingly, the city crowds passed him by.  They saw  the raw stranger stand in the gutter and stretch his neck at the tall  buildings.  At this they ceased to smile, and even to look at him.  It  had been done so often.  A few glanced at the antique valise to see  what Coney "attraction" or brand of chewing gum he might be  thus dinning into his memory.  But for the most part he was  ignored.  Even the newsboys looked bored when he scampered like  a circus clown out of the way of cabs and street cars. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        At Eighth Avenue stood "Bunco Harry," with his dyed mustache  and shiny, good-natured eyes.  Harry was too good an artist not to  be pained at the sight of an actor overdoing his part.  He edged up  to the countryman, who had stopped to open his mouth at a  jewelry store window, and shook his head. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Too thick, pal," he said, critically - "too thick by a couple of  inches.  I don't know what your lay is; but you've got the properties  too thick.  That hay, now - why, they don't even allow that on  Proctor's circuit any more." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I don't understand you, mister," said the green one.  "I'm not  lookin' for any circus.  I've just run down from Ulster County to  look at the town, bein' that the hayin's over with.  Gosh! but it's a  whopper.  I thought Poughkeepsie was some punkins; but this here  town is five times as big." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Oh, well," said "Bunco Harry," raising his eyebrows, "I didn't  mean to butt in.  You don't have to tell.  I thought you ought to  tone down a little, so I tried to put you wise.  Wish you success at  your graft, whatever it is.  Come and have a drink, anyhow." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I wouldn't mind having a glass of lager beer," acknowledged the  other. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        They went to a cafe frequented by men with smooth faces and  shifty eyes, and sat at their drinks. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I'm glad I come across you, mister," said Haylocks.  "How'd you  like to play a game or two of seven-up?  I've got the keerds." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He fished them out of Noah's valise - a rare, inimitable deck,  greasy with bacon suppers and grimy with the soil of cornfields. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Bunco Harry" laughed loud and briefly. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Not for me, sport," he said, firmly.  "I don't go against that make-up of yours for a cent.  But I still say you've overdone it.  The  Reubs haven't dressed like that since '79.  I doubt if you could  work Brooklyn for a key-winding watch with that layout." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Oh, you needn't think I ain't got the money," boasted Haylocks.   He drew forth a tightly rolled mass of bills as large as a teacup,  and laid it on the table. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Got that for my share of grandmother's farm," he announced.   "There's $950 in that roll.  Thought I'd come to the city and look  around for a likely business to go into." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Bunco Harry" took up the roll of money and looked at it with  almost respect in his smiling eyes. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I've seen worse," he said, critically.  "But you'll never do it in  them clothes.  You want to get light tan shoes and a black suit and  a straw hat with a colored band, and talk a good deal about  Pittsburg and freight differentials, and drink sherry for breakfast in  order to work off phony stuff like that." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "What's his line?" asked two or three shifty-eyed men of "Bunco  Harry" after Haylocks had gathered up his impugned money and  departed. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The queer, I guess," said Harry.  "Or else he's one of Jerome's  men.  Or some guy with a new graft.  He's too much hayseed.   Maybe that his - I wonder now - oh, no, it couldn't have been real  money." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Haylocks wandered on.  Thirst probably assailed him again, for he  dived into a dark groggery on a side street and bought beer.  At  first sight of him their eyes brightened; but when his insistent and  exaggerated rusticity became apparent their expressions changed  to wary suspicion. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Haylocks swung his valise across the bar. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Keep that a while for me, mister," he said, chewing at the end of a  virulent claybank cigar.  "I'll be back after I knock around a spell.   And keep your eye on it, for there's $950 inside of it, though  maybe you wouldn't think so to look at me." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Somewhere outside a phonograph struck up a band piece, and  Haylocks was off for it, his coat-tail buttons flopping in the middle  of his back. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Divvy, Mike," said the men hanging upon the bar, winking  openly at one another. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Honest, now," said the bartender, kicking the valise to one side.   "You don't think I'd fall to that, do you?  Anybody can see he ain't  no jay.  One of McAdoo's come-on squad, I guess.  He's a shine if  he made himself up.  There ain't no parts of the country now where  they dress like that since they run rural free delivery to Providence,  Rhode Island.  If he's got nine-fifty in that valise it's a ninety-eight  cent Waterbury that's stopped at ten minutes to ten." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        When Haylocks had exhausted the resources of Mr. Edison to  amuse he returned for his valise.  And then down Broadway he  gallivanted, culling the sights with his eager blue eyes.  But still  and evermore Broadway rejected him with curt glances and  sardonic smiles.  He was the oldest of the "gags" that the city must  endure.  He was so flagrantly impossible, so ultra rustic, so  exaggerated beyond the most freakish products of the barnyard,  the hayfield and the vaudeville stage, that he excited only  weariness and suspicion.  And the wisp of hay in his hair was so  genuine, so fresh and redolent of the meadows, so clamorously  rural that even a shellgame man would have put up his peas and  folded his table at the sight of it. </p></div>

			<div class="pagers" id="5"><a href="PoetPeas.shtml.html#4"><b>&lt;</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="PoetPeas.shtml.html#5">5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="PoetPeas.shtml.html#6"><b>&gt;</b></a></div>
			
			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Haylocks seated himself upon a flight of stone steps and once  more exhumed his roll of yellow-backs from the valise.  The outer  one, a twenty, he shucked off and beckoned to a newsboy. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Son," said he, "run somewhere and get this changed for me.  I'm  mighty nigh out of chicken feed.  I guess you'll get a nickel if  you'll hurry up." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        A hurt look appeared through the dirt on the newsy's face. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Aw, watchert'ink!  G'wan and get yer funny bill changed yerself.   Dey ain't no farm clothes yer got on.  G'wan wit yer stage money." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        On a corner lounged a keen-eyed steerer for a gambling-house.  He  was Haylocks, and his expression suddenly grew cold and  virtuous. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Mister," said the rural one.  "I've heard of places in this here town  where a fellow could have a good game of old sledge or peg a card  at keno.  I got $950 in this valise, and I come down from old  Ulster to see the sights.  Know where a fellow could get action on  about $9 or $10?  I'm goin' to have some sport, and then maybe I'll  buy out a business of some kind." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The steerer looked pained, and investigated a white speck on his  left forefinger nail. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Cheese it, old man," he murmured, reproachfully.  "The Central  Office must be bughouse to send you out looking like such a gillie.   You couldn't get within two blocks of a sidewalk crap game in  them Tony Pastor props.  The recent Mr. Scotty from Death Valley  has got you beat a crosstown block in the way of Elizabethan  scenery and mechanical accessories.  Let it be skiddoo for yours.   Nay, I know of no gilded halls where one may bet a patrol wagon  on the ace." </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Rebuffed once again by the great city that is so swift to detect  artificialities, Haylocks sat upon the curb and presented his  thoughts to hold a conference. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "It's my clothes," said he; "durned if it ain't.  They think I'm a  hayseed and won't have nothin' to do with me.  Nobody never  made fun of this hat in Ulster County.  I guess if you want folks to  notice you in New York you must dress up like they do." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        So Haylocks went shopping in the bazaars where men spake  through their noses and rubbed their hands and ran the tape line  ecstatically over the buldge in his inside pocket where reposed a  red nubbin of corn with an even number of rows.  And messengers  bearing parcels and boxes streamed to his hotel on Broadway  within the lights of Long Acre. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        At 9 o'clock in the evening one descended to the sidewalk whom  Ulster County would have foresworn.  Bright tan were his shoes;  his hat the latest block.  His light gray trousers were deeply  creased; a gay blue silk handkerchief flapped from the breast  pocket of his elegant English walking coat.  His collar might have  graced a laundry window; his blond hair was trimmed close; the  wisp of hay was gone. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        For an instant he stood, resplendent, with the leisurely air of a  boulevardier concocting in his mind the route for his evening  pleasures.  And then he turned down the gay, bright street with the  easy and graceful tread of a millionaire. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        But in the instant that he had paused the wisest and keenest eyes in  the city had enveloped him in their field of vision.  A stout man  with gray eyes picked two of his friends with a lift of his eyebrows  from the row of loungers in front of the hotel. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The juiciest jay I've seen in six months," said the man with gray  eyes.  "Come along." </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        It was half-past eleven when a man galloped into the West Forty-seventh Street Police Station with the story of his wrongs. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Nine hundred and fifty dollars," he gasped, "all my share of  grandmother's farm." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The desk seargeant wrung from him the name Jabez Bulltongue, of  Locust Valley farm, Ulster County, and then bagan to take  descriptions of the strong-arm gentlemen. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        When Conant went to see the editor about the fate of his poem, he  was received over the head of the office boy into the inner office  that is decorated with the statuettes by Rodin and J. G. Brown. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "When I read the first line of 'The Doe and the Brook,'" said the  editor, "I knew it to be the work of one whose life has been heart to  heart with Nature.  The finished art of the line did not blind me to  that fact.  To use a somewhat homely comparison, it was as if a  wild, free child of the woods and fields were to don the garb of  fashion and walk down Broadway.  Beneath the apparel the man  would show." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Thanks," said Conant.  "I suppose the check will be round on  Thursday, as usual." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The morals of this story have somehow gotten mixed.  You can  take your choice of "Stay on the Farm" or "Don't Write Poetry."</div>
