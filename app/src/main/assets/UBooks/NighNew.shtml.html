<div class="story_text" id="1"><p>The great city of Bagdad-on-the-Subway is caliph-ridden.  Its  palaces, bazaars, khans, and byways are thronged with Al Rashids  in divers disguises, seeking diversion and victims for their  unbridled generosity.  You can scarcely find a poor beggar whom  they are willing to let enjoy his spoils unsuccored, nor a wrecked  unfortunate upon whom they will not reshower the means of fresh  misfortune.  You will hardly find anywhere a hungry one who has  not had the opportunity to tighten his belt in gift libraries, nor  a poor pundit who has not blushed at the holiday basket of celery-crowned turkey forced resoundingly through his door by the  eleemosynary press. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        So then, fearfully through the Harun-haunted streets creep the  one-eyed calenders, the Little Hunchback and the Barber's Sixth  Brother, hoping to escape the ministrations of the roving horde  of caliphoid sultans. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Entertainment for many Arabian nights might be had from the  histories of those who have escaped the largesse of the army of  Commanders of the Faithful.  Until dawn you might sit on the  enchanted rug and listen to such stories as are told of the powerful  genie Roc-Ef-El-Er who sent the Forty Thieves to soak up the oil  plant of Ali Baba; of the good Caliph Kar-Neg-Ghe, who gave  away palaces; of the Seven Voyages of Sailbad, the Sinner, who  frequented wooden excursion steamers among the islands; of the  Fisherman and the Bottle; of the Barmecides' Boarding house; of  Aladdin's rise to wealth by means of his Wonderful Gasmeter. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        But now, there being ten sultans to one Sheherazade, she is held too  valuable to be in fear of the bowstring.  In consequence the art of  narrative languishes.  And, as the lesser caliphs are hunting the  happy poor and the resigned unfortunate from cover to cover in order  to heap upon them strange mercies and mysterious benefits, too often  comes the report from Arabian headquarters that the captive refused  "to talk." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        This reticence, then, in the actors who perform the sad comedies of  their philanthropy-scourged world, must, in a degree, account for  the shortcomings of this painfully gleaned tale, which shall be  called: THE STORY OF THE CALIPH WHO ALLEVIATED HIS CONSCIENCE</P> Old Jacob Spraggins mixed for himself some Scotch and lithia water  at his $1,200 oak sideboard.  Inspiration must have resulted from  its imbibition, for immediately afterward he struck the quartered  oak soundly with his fist and shouted to the empty dining room: </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "By the coke ovens of hell, it must be that ten thousand dollars!   If I can get that squared, it'll do the trick." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Thus, by the commonest artifice of the trade, having gained your  interest, the action of the story will now be suspended, leaving you  grumpily to consider a sort of dull biography beginning fifteen  years before. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        When old Jacob was young Jacob he was a breaker boy in a Pennsylvania  coal mine.  I don't know what a breaker boy is; but his occupation  seems to be standing by a coal dump with a wan look and a dinner-pail  to have his picture taken for magazine articles.  Anyhow, Jacob was  one.  But, instead of dying of overwork at nine, and leaving his  helpless parents and brothers at the mercy of the union strikers'  reserve fund, he hitched up his galluses, put a dollar or two in a  side proposition now and then, and at forty-five was worth  $20,000,000. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        There now! it's over.  Hardly had time to yawn, did you?  I've seen  biographies that - but let us dissemble. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I want you to consider Jacob Spraggins, Esq., after he had arrived  at the seventh stage of his career.  The stages meant are, first,  humble origin; second, deserved promotion; third, stockholder;  fourth, capitalist; fifth, trust magnate; sixth, rich malefactor;  seventh, caliph; eighth, <i>x</i>.  The eighth stage shall be left to  the higher mathematics. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        At fifty-five Jacob retired from active business.  The income of a  czar was still rolling in on him from coal, iron, real estate, oil,  railroads, manufactories, and corporations, but none of it touched  Jacob's hands in a raw state.  It was a sterilized increment,  carefully cleaned and dusted and fumigated until it arrived at its  ultimate stage of untainted, spotless checks in the white fingers of  his private secretary.  Jacob built a three-million-dollar palace on  a corner lot fronting on Nabob Avenue, city of New Bagdad, and  began to feel the mantle of the late H. A. Rashid descending upon  him.  Eventually Jacob slipped the mantle under his collar, tied it  in a neat four-in-hand, and became a licensed harrier of our  Mesopotamian proletariat. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        When a man's income becomes so large that the butcher actually  sends him the kind of steak he orders, he begins to think about his  soul's salvation.  Now, the various stages or classes of rich men  must not be forgotten.  The capitalist can tell you to a dollar the  amount of his wealth.  The trust magnate "estimates" it.  The rich  malefactor hands you a cigar and denies that he has bought the P.  D. & Q.  The caliph merely smiles and talks about Hammerstein and  the musical lasses.  There is a record of tremendous altercation  at breakfast in a "Where-to-Dine-Well" tavern between a magnate  and his wife, the rift within the loot being that the wife calculated  their fortune at a figure $3,000,000 higher than did her future  <i>divorce</i>.  Oh, well, I, myself, heard a similar quarrel between a  man and his wife because he found fifty cents less in his pockets  than he thought he had.  After all, we are all human - Count Tolstoi,  R. Fitzsimmons, Peter Pan, and the rest of us. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Don't lose heart because the story seems to be degenerating into a  sort of moral essay for intellectual readers. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        There will be dialogue and stage business pretty soon. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        When Jacob first began to compare the eyes of needles with the  camels in the Zoo he decided upon organized charity.  He had his  secretary send a check for one million to the Universal Benevolent  Association of the Globe.  You may have looked down through a  grating in front of a decayed warehouse for a nickel that you had  dropped through.  But that is neither here nor there.  The  Association acknowledged receipt of his favor of the 24th ult. with  enclosure as stated.  Separated by a double line, but still mighty  close to the matter under the caption of "Oddities of the Day's  News" in an evening paper, Jacob Spraggins read that one "Jasper  Spargyous" had "donated $100,000 to the U. B. A. of G."  A camel  may have a stomach for each day in the week; but I dare not venture  to accord him whiskers, for fear of the Great Displeasure at  Washington; but if he have whiskers, surely not one of them will  seem to have been inserted in the eye of a needle by that effort of  that rich man to enter the K. of H.  The right is reserved to reject  any and all bids; signed, S. Peter, secretary and gatekeeper. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Next, Jacob selected the best endowed college he could scare up  and presented it with a $200,000 laboratory.  The college did not  maintain a scientific course, but it accepted the money and built  an elaborate lavatory instead, which was no diversion of funds so  far as Jacob ever discovered. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The faculty met and invited Jacob to come over and take his A B C  degree.  Before sending the invitation they smiled, cut out the C,  added the proper punctuation marks, and all was well. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        While walking on the campus before being capped and gowned,  Jacob saw two professors strolling nearby.  Their voices, long  adapted to indoor acoustics, undesignedly reached his ear. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "There goes the latest <i>chevalier d'industrie</i>," said one of them,  "to buy a sleeping powder from us.  He gets his degree to-morrow." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "<i>In foro conscientai</i>," said the other.  "Let's 'eave 'arf a brick  at 'im." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Jacob ignored the Latin, but the brick pleasantry was not too hard  for him.  There was no mandragora in the honorary draught of  learning that he had bought.  That was before the passage of the  Pure Food and Drugs Act. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Jacob wearied of philanthropy on a large scale. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "If I could see folks made happier," he said to himself - "If I could  see 'em myself and hear 'em express their gratitude for what I done  for 'em it would make me feel better.  This donatin' funds to  institutions and societies is about as satisfactory as dropping  money into a broken slot machine." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        So Jacob followed his nose, which led him through unswept streets  to the homes of the poorest. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The very thing!" said Jacob.  "I will charter two river steamboats,  pack them full of these unfortunate children and - say ten thousand  dolls and drums and a thousand freezers of ice cream, and give  them a delightful outing up the Sound.  The sea breezes on that  trip ought to blow the taint off some of this money that keeps  coming in faster than I can work it off my mind." </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Jacob must have leaked some of his benevolent intentions, for an  immense person with a bald face and a mouth that looked as if it  ought to have a "Drop Letters Here" sign over it hooked a finger  around him and set him in a space between a barber's pole and a  stack of ash cans.  Words came out of the post-office slit - smooth,  husky words with gloves on 'em, but sounding as if they might turn  to bare knuckles any moment. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Say, Sport, do you know where you are at?  Well, dis is Mike  O'Grady's district you're buttin' into - see?  Mike's got de stomach-ache privilege for every kid in dis neighborhood - see?  And if  dere's any picnics or red balloons to be dealt out here, Mike's  money pays for 'em - see?  Don't you butt in, or something'll be  handed to you.  Youse d - - settlers and reformers with your social  ologies and your millionaire detectives have got dis district in a  hell of a fix, anyhow.  With your college students and professors  rough-housing de soda-water stands and dem rubber-neck coaches  fillin' de streets, de folks down here are 'fraid to go out of de  houses.  Now, you leave 'em to Mike.  Dey belongs to him, and he  knows how to handle 'em.  Keep on your own side of de town.  Are  you some wiser now, uncle, or do you want to scrap wit' Mike  O'Grady for de Santa Claus belt in dis district?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Clearly, that spot in the moral vineyard was preempted.  So Caliph  Spraggins menaced no more the people in the bazaars of the East  Side.  To keep down his growing surplus he doubled his donations  to organized charity, presented the Y. M. C. A. of his native town  with a $10,000 collection of butterflies, and sent a check to the  famine sufferers in China big enough to buy new emerald eyes and  diamond-filled teeth for all their gods.  But none of these  charitable acts seemed to bring peace to the caliph's heart.  He  tried to get a personal note into his benefactions by tipping  bellboys and waiters $10 and $20 bills. He got well snickered at  and derided for that by the minions who accept with respect  gratuities commensurate to the service performed.  He sought out  an ambitious and talented but poor young woman, and bought for  her the star part in a new comedy.  He might have gotten rid of  $50,000 more of his cumbersome money in this philanthropy if he  had not neglected to write letters to her.  But she lost the suit  for lack of evidence, while his capital still kept piling up, and  his <i>optikos needleorum camelibus</i> - or rich man's disease - was  unrelieved. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        In Caliph Spraggins's $3,000,000 home lived his sister Henrietta,  who used to cook for the coal miners in a twenty-five-cent eating  house in Coketown, Pa., and who now would have offered John  Mitchell only two fingers of her hand to shake.  And his daughter  Celia, nineteen, back from boarding-school and from being polished  off by private instructors in the restaurant languages and those  'etudes and things. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Celia is the heroine.  Lest the artist's delineation of her charms  on this very page humbug your fancy, take from me her authorized  description.  She was a nice-looking, awkward, loud, rather  bashful, brown-haired girl, with a sallow complexion, bright eyes,  and a perpetual smile.  She had a wholesome, Spraggins-inherited  love for plain food, loose clothing, and the society of the lower  classes.  She had too much health and youth to feel the burden of  wealth.  She had a wide mouth that kept the peppermint-pepsin  tablets rattling like hail from the slot-machine wherever she went,  and she could whistle hornpipes.  Keep this picture in mind; and  let the artist do his worst. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Celia looked out of her window one day and gave her heart to the  grocer's young man.  The receiver thereof was at that moment  engaged in conceding immortality to his horse and calling down  upon him the ultimate fate of the wicked; so he did not notice the  transfer.  A horse should stand still when you are lifting a crate  of strictly new-laid eggs out of the wagon. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Young lady reader, you would have liked that grocer's young man  yourself.  But you wouldn't have given him your heart, because  you are saving it for a riding-master, or a shoe-manufacturer with  a torpid liver, or something quiet but rich in gray tweeds at Palm  Beach.  Oh, I know about it.  So I am glad the grocer's young man  was for Celia, and not for you. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The grocer's young man was slim and straight and as confident  and easy in his movements as the man in the back of the magazines  who wears the new frictionless roller suspenders.  He wore a  gray bicycle cap on the back of his head, and his hair was  straw-colored and curly, and his sunburned face looked like one  that smiled a good deal when he was not preaching the doctrine of  everlasting punishment to delivery-wagon horses.  He slung  imported A1 fancy groceries about as though they were only the  stuff he delivered at boarding-houses; and when he picked up his  whip, your mind instantly recalled Mr. Tacktt and his air with  the buttonless foils. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Tradesmen delivered their goods at a side gate at the rear of  the house.  The grocer's wagon came about ten in the morning.   For three days Celia watched the driver when he came, finding  something new each time to admire in the lofty and almost  contemptuous way he had of tossing around the choicest gifts of  Pomona, Ceres, and the canning factories.  Then she consulted  Annette. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        To be explicit, Annette McCorkle, the second housemaid who  deserves a paragraph herself.  Annette Fletcherized large numbers  of romantic novels which she obtained at a free public library  branch (donated by one of the biggest caliphs in the business).   She was Celia's sidekicker and chum, though Aunt Henrietta didn't  know it, you may hazard a bean or two. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Oh, canary-bird seed!" exclaimed Annette.  "Ain't it a corkin'  situation?  You a heiress, and fallin' in love with him on sight!   He's a sweet boy, too, and above his business.  But he ain't  susceptible like the common run of grocer's assistants.  He never  pays no attention to me." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "He will to me," said Celia. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Riches -" began Annette, unsheathing the not unjustifiable  feminine sting. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Oh, you're not so beautiful," said Celia, with her wide, disarming  smile.  "Neither am I; but he sha'n't know that there's any money  mixed up with my looks, such as they are.  That's fair.  Now, I  want you to lend me one of your caps and an apron, Annette." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Oh, marshmallows!" cried Annette.  "I see.  Ain't it lovely?  It's  just like 'Lurline, the Left-Handed; or, A Buttonhole Maker's  Wrongs.'  I'll bet he'll turn out to be a count." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        There was a long hallway (or "passageway," as they call it in the  land of the Colonels) with one side latticed, running along the rear  of the house.  The grocer's young man went through this to deliver  his goods.  One morning he passed a girl in there with shining  eyes, sallow complexion, and wide, smiling mouth, wearing a maid's  cap and apron.  But as he was cumbered with a basket of Early  Drumhead lettuce and Trophy tomatoes and three bunches of asparagus  and six bottles of the most expensive Queen olives, he saw no more  than that she was one of the maids. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        But on his way out he came up behind her, and she was whistling  "Fisher's Hornpipe" so loudly and clearly that all the piccolos in  the world should have disjointed themselves and crept into their  cases for shame. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The grocer's young man stopped and pushed back his cap until it  hung on his collar button behind. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "That's out o' sight, Kid," said he. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "My name is Celia, if you please," said the whistler, dazzling him  with a three-inch smile. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        That's all right.  I'm Thomas McLeod.  What part of the house do  you work in?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I'm the - the second parlor maid." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Do you know the 'Falling Waters'?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "No," said Celia, "we don't know anybody.  We got rich too quick - that  is, Mr. Spraggins did." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I'll make you acquainted," said Thomas McLeod.  "It's a strathspey -  the first cousin to a hornpipe." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        If Celia's whistling put the piccolos out of commission, Thomas  McLeod's surely made the biggest flutes hunt their holes.  He  could actually whistle <i>bass</i>. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        When he stopped Celia was ready to jump into his delivery wagon  and ride with him clear to the end of the pier and on to the ferry-boat of the Charon line. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I'll be around to-morrow at 10:15," said Thomas, "with some  spinach and a case of carbonic." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I'll practice that what-you-may-call-it," said Celia.  "I can whistle  a fine second." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The processes of courtship are personal, and do not belong to general  literature.  They should be chronicled in detail only in advertisements  of iron tonics and in the secret by-laws of the Woman's Auxiliary of  the Ancient Order of the Rat Trap.  But genteel writing may contain  a description of certain stages of its progress without intruding upon  the province of the X-ray or of park policemen. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        A day came when Thomas McLeod and Celia lingered at the end  of the latticed "passage." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Sixteen a week isn't much," said Thomas, letting his cap rest on  his shoulder blades. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Celia looked through the lattice-work and whistled a dead march.   Shopping with Aunt Henrietta the day before, she had paid that much  for a dozen handkerchiefs. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Maybe I'll get a raise next month," said Thomas.  "I'll be around  to-morrow at the same time with a bag of flour and the laundry  soap." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "All right," said Celia.  "Annette's married cousin pays only $20 a  month for a flat in the Bronx." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Never for a moment did she count on the Spraggins money.  She knew  Aunt Henrietta's invincible pride of caste and pa's mightiness  as a Colossus of cash, and she understood that if she chose Thomas  she and her grocer's young man might go whistle for a living. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Another day came, Thomas violating the dignity of Nabob Avenue  with "The Devil's Dream," whistled keenly between his teeth. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Raised to eighteen a week yesterday," he said.  "Been pricing flats  around Morningside.  You want to start untying those apron strings  and unpinning that cap, old girl." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Oh, Tommy!" said Celia, with her broadest smile.  "Won't that be  enough?  I got Betty to show me how to make a cottage pudding.  I  guess we could call it a flat pudding if we wanted to." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "And tell no lie," said Thomas. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "And I can sweep and polish and dust - of course, a parlor maid  learns that.  And we cold whistle duets of evenings." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The old man said he'd raise me to twenty at Christmas if Bryan  couldn't think of any harder name to call a Republican than a  'postponer,'" said the grocer's young man. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I can sew," said Celia; "and I know that you must make the gas  company's man show his badge when he comes to look at the meter;  and I know how to put up quince jam and window curtains." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Bully! you're all right, Cele.  Yes, I believe we can pull it off on  eighteen." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        As he was jumping into the wagon the second parlor maid braved  discovery by running swiftly to the gate. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "And, oh, Tommy, I forgot," she called, softly.  "I believe I could  make your neckties." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Forget it," said Thomas decisively. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "And another thing," she continued.  "Sliced cucumbers at night will  drive away cockroaches." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "And sleep, too, you bet," said Mr. McLeod.  "Yes, I believe if I  have a delivery to make on the West Side this afternoon I'll look in  at a furniture store I know over there." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        It was just as the wagon dashed away that old Jacob Spraggins struck  the sideboard with his fist and made the mysterious remark about  ten thousand dollars that you perhaps remember.  Which justifies  the reflection that some stories, as well as life, and puppies  thrown into wells, move around in circles.  Painfully but briefly  we must shed light on Jacob's words. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The foundation of his fortune was made when he was twenty.  A poor  coal-digger (ever hear of a rich one?) had saved a dollar or two  and bought a small tract of land on a hillside on which he tried  to raise corn.  Not a nubbin.  Jacob, whose nose was a divining-rod,  told him there was a vein of coal beneath.  he bought the land from  the miner for $125 and sold it a month afterward for $10,000.   Luckily the miner had enough left of his sale money to drink himself  into a black coat opening in the back, as soon as he heard the news. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And so, for forty years afterward, we find Jacob illuminated with  the sudden thought that if he could make restitution of this sum of  money to the heirs or assigns of the unlucky miner, respite and  Nepenthe might be his. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And now must come swift action, for we have here some four thousand  words and not a tear shed and never a pistol, joke, safe, nor bottle  cracked. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Old Jacob hired a dozen private detectives to find the heirs, if any  existed, of the old miner, Hugh McLeod. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Get the point?  Of course I know as well as you do that Thomas is  going to be the heir.  I might have concealed the name; but why  always hold back you mystery till the end?  I say, let it come near  the middle so people can stop reading there if they want to. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        After the detectives had trailed false clues about three thousand  dollars - I mean miles - they cornered Thomas at the grocery and  got his confession that Hugh McLeod had been his grandfather,  and that there were no other heirs.  They arranged a meeting for  him and old Jacob one morning in one of their offices. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Jacob liked the young man very much.  He liked the way he looked  straight at him when he talked, and the way he threw his bicycle  cap over the top of a rose-colored vase on the centre-table. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        There was a slight flaw in Jacob's system of restitution.  He did  not consider that the act, to be perfect, should include confession.   So he represented himself to be the agent of the purchaser of the  land who had sent him to refund the sale price for the ease of his  conscience. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Well, sir," said Thomas, "this sounds to me like an illustrated  post-card from South Boston with 'We're having a good time here'  written on it.  I don't know the game.  Is this ten thousand dollars  money, or do I have to save so many coupons to get it?" </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Old Jacob counted out to him twenty five-hundred-dollar bills. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        That was better, he thought, than a check.  Thomas put them  thoughtfully into his pocket. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Grandfather's best thanks," he said, "to the party who sends it." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Jacob talked on, asking him about his work, how he spent his  leisure time, and what his ambitions were.  The more he saw and  heard of Thomas, the better he liked him.  He had not met many  young men in Bagdad so frank and wholesome. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I would like to have you visit my house," he said.  "I might help  you in investing or laying out your money.  I am a very wealthy  man.  I have a daughter about grown, and I would like for you to  know her.  There are not many young men I would care to have call  on her." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I'm obliged," said Thomas.  "I'm not much at making calls.  It's  generally the side entrance for mine.  And, besides, I'm engaged to  a girl that has the Delaware peach crop killed in the blossom.   She's a parlor maid in a house where I deliver goods.  She won't be  working there much longer, though.  Say, don't forget to give your  friend my grandfather's best regards.  You'll excuse me now; my  wagon's outside with a lot of green stuff that's got to be delivered.   See you again, sir." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        At eleven Thomas delivered some bunches of parsley and lettuce  at the Spraggins mansion.  Thomas was only twenty-two; so, as he  came back, he took out the handful of five-hundred-dollar bills  and waved them carelessly.  Annette took a pair of eyes as big as  creamed onion to the cook. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I told you he was a count," she said, after relating.  "He never  would carry on with me." </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "But you say he showed money," said the cook. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Hundreds of thousands," said Annette.  "Carried around loose in  his pockets.  And he never would look at me." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "It was paid to me to-day," Thomas was explaining to Celia outside.   "It came from my grandfather's estate.  Say, Cele, what's the use  of waiting now?  I'm going to quit the job to-night.  Why can't we  get married next week?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Tommy," said Celia.  "I'm no parlor maid.  I've been fooling you.   I'm Miss Spraggins - Celia Spraggins.  The newspapers say I'll be  worth forty million dollars some day." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Thomas pulled his cap down straight on his head for the first time  since we have known him. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I suppose then," said he, "I suppose then you'll not be marrying  me next week.  But you <i>can</i> whistle." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "No," said Celia, "I'll not be marrying you next week.  My father  would never let me marry a grocer's clerk.  But I'll marry you  to-night, Tommy, if you say so." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Old Jacob Spraggins came home at 9:30 P. M., in his motor car.   The make of it you will have to surmise sorrowfully; I am giving  you unsubsidized fiction; had it been a street car I could have told  you its voltage and the number of wheels it had.  Jacob called for  his daughter; he had bought a ruby necklace for her, and wanted to  hear her say what a kind, thoughtful, dear old dad he was. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        There was a brief search in the house for her, and then came  Annette, glowing with the pure flame of truth and loyalty well  mixed with envy and histrionics. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Oh, sir," said she, wondering if she should kneel, "Miss Celia's  just this minute running away out of the side gate with a young  man to be married.  I couldn't stop her, sir.  They went in a cab." </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "What young man?" roared old Jacob. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "A millionaire, if you please, sir - a rich nobleman in disguise.  He  carries his money with him, and the red peppers and the onions was  only to blind us, sir.  He never did seem to take to me." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Jacob rushed out in time to catch his car.  The chauffeur had been  delayed by trying to light a cigarette in the wind. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Here, Gaston, or Mike, or whatever you call yourself, scoot around  the corner quicker than blazes and see if you can see a cab.  If you  do, run it down." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        There was a cab in sight a block away.  Gaston, or Mike, with his  eyes half shut and his mind on his cigarette, picked up the trail,  neatly crowded the cab to the curb and pocketed it. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "What t'ell you doin'?" yelled the cabman. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Pa!" shrieked Celia. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Grandfather's remorseful friend's agent!" said Thomas.  "Wonder  what's on his conscience now." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "A thousand thunders," said Gaston, or Mike.  "I have no other  match." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Young man," said old Jacob, severely, "how about that parlor  maid you were engaged to?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        A couple of years afterward old Jacob went into the office of his  private secretary. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The Amalgamated Missionary Society solicits a contribution of  $30,000 toward the conversion of the Koreans," said the secretary. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Pass 'em up," said Jacob. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The University of Plumville writes that its yearly endowment  fund of $50,000 that you bestowed upon it is past due." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Tell 'em it's been cut out." </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The Scientific Society of Clam Cove, Long Island, asks for  $10,000 to buy alcohol to preserve specimens." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Waste basket." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The Society for Providing Healthful Recreation for Working Girls  wants $20,000 from you to lay out a golf course." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Tell 'em to see an undertaker." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Cut 'em all out," went on Jacob.  "I've quit being a good thing.  I  need every dollar I can scrape or save.  I want you to write to the  directors of every company that I'm interested in and recommend a  10 per cent. cut in salaries.  And say - I noticed half a cake of soap  lying in a corner of the hall as I came in.  I want you to speak to  the scrubwoman about waste.  I've got no money to throw away.  And  say - we've got vinegar pretty well in hand, haven't we?' </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The Globe Spice & Seasons Company," said secretary, "controls  the market at present." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Raise vinegar two cents a gallon.  Notify all our branches." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Suddenly Jacob Spraggin's plump red face relaxed into a pulpy  grin.  He walked over to the secretary's desk and showed a small  red mark on his thick forefinger. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Bit it," he said, "darned if he didn't, and he ain't had the tooth  three weeks - Jaky McLeod, my Celia's kid.  He'll be worth a hundred  millions by the time he's twenty-one if I can pile it up for him." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        As he was leaving, old Jacob turned at the door, and said: </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Better make that vinegar raise three cents instead of two.  I'll be  back in an hour and sign the letters." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The true history of the Caliph Harun Al Rashid relates that toward  the end of his reign he wearied of philanthropy, and caused to be  beheaded all his former favorites and companions of his "Arabian  Nights" rambles.  Happy are we in these days of enlightenment,  when the only death warrant the caliphs can serve on us is in the  form of a tradesman's bill.</div>
