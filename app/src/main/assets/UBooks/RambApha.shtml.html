<div class="story_text" id="1"><p>My wife and I parted on that morning in precisely our usual  manner.  She left her second cup of tea to follow me to the front  door.  There she plucked from my lapel the invisible strand of lint  (the universal act of woman to proclaim ownership) and bade me  to take care of my cold.  I had no cold.  Next came her kiss of  parting - the lever kiss of domesticity flavored with Young Hyson.   There was no fear of the extemporaneous, of variety spicing her  infinite custom.  With the deft touch of long malpractice, she  dabbed awry my well-set scarf pin; and then, as I closed the door, I  heard her morning slippers pattering back to her cooling tea. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        When I set out I had no thought or premonition of what was to  occur.  The attack came suddenly. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        For many weeks I had been toiling, almost night and day, at a  famous railroad law case that I won triumphantly but a few days  previously.  In fact, I had been digging away at the law almost  without cessation for many years.  Once or twice good Doctor  Volney, my friend and physician, had warned me. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "If you don't slacken up, Belford," he said, "you'll go suddenly to  pieces.  Either your nerves or your brain will give way.  Tell me,  does a week pass in which you do not read in the papers of a case  of aphasia - of some man lost, wandering nameless, with his past  and his identity blotted out - and all from that little brain clot  made by overwork or worry?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I always thought," said I, "that the clot in those instances was  really to be found on the brains of the newspaper reporters." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Doctor Volney shook his head. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The disease exists," he said.  "You need a change or a rest.   Court-room, office and home - there is the only route you travel.   For recreation you - read law books.  Better take warning in time." </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "On Thursday nights," I said, defensively, "my wife and I play  cribbage.  On Sundays she reads to me the weekly letter from her  mother.  That law books are not a recreation remains yet to be  established." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        That morning as I walked I was thinking of Doctor Volney's words.   I was feeling as well as I usually did - possibly in better  spirits than usual. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I woke with stiff and cramped muscles from having slept long on  the incommodious seat of a day coach.  I leaned my head against  the seat and tried to think.  After a long time I said to myself:   "I must have a name of some sort."  I searched my pockets.  Not  a card; not a letter; not a paper or monogram could I find.   But I found in my coat pocket nearly $3,000 in bills of large  denomination.  "I must be some one, of course," I repeated to  myself, and began again to consider. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The car was well crowded with men, among whom, I told myself,  there must have been some common interest, for they intermingled  freely, and seemed in the best good humor and spirits.  One of  them - a stout, spectacled gentleman enveloped in a decided odor  of cinnamon and aloes - took the vacant half of my seat with a  friendly nod, and unfolded a newspaper.  In the intervals between  his periods of reading, we conversed, as travelers will, on current  affairs.  I found myself able to sustain the conversation on such  subjects with credit, at least to my memory.  By and by my  companion said: </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "You are one of us, of course.  Fine lot of men the West sends in  this time.  I'm glad they held the convention in New York; I've  never been East before.  My name's R. P. Bolder - Bolder & Son,  of Hickory Grove, Missouri." </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Though unprepared, I rose to the emergency, as men will when put  to it.  Now must I hold a christening, and be at once babe, parson  and parent.  My senses came to the rescue of my slower brain.   The insistent odor of drugs from my compainion supplied one  idea; a glance at his newspaper, where my eye met a conspicuous  advertisement, assisted me further. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "My name," said I, glibly, "is Edward Pinkhammer.  I am a  druggist, and my home is in Cornopolis, Kansas." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I knew you were a druggist," said my fellow traveler, affably.  "I  saw the callous spot on your right forefinger where the handle of  the pestle rubs.  Of course, you are a delegate to our National  Convention." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Are all these men druggists?" I asked, wonderingly. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "They are.  This car came through from the West.  And they're  your old-time druggists, too - none of your patent tablet-and-granule pharmashootists that use slot machines instead of a  prescription desk.  We percolate our own paregoric and roll our  own pills, and we ain't above handling a few garden seeds in the  spring, and carrying a side line of confectionery and shoes.  I tell  you Hampinker, I've got an idea to spring on this convention - new  ideas is what they want.  Now, you know the shelf bottles of tartar  emetic and Rochelle salt Ant. et Pot. Tart. and Sod. et Pot. Tart. -  one's poison, you know, and the other's harmless.  It's easy to  mistake one label for the other.  Where do druggists mostly keep  'em?  Why, as far apart as possible, on different shelves.  That's  wrong.  I say keep 'em side by side, so when you want one you can  always compare it with the other and avoid mistakes.  Do you  catch the idea?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "It seems to me a very good one," I said. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "All right!  When I spring it on the convention you back it up.   We'll make some of these Eastern orange-phosphate-and-massage-cream professors that think they're the only lozenges in the market  look like hypodermic tablets." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "If I can be of any aid," I said, warming, "the two bottles of - er -" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Tartrate of antimony and potash, and tartrate of soda and potash." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Shall henceforth sit side by side," I concluded, firmly. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Now, there's another thing," said Mr. Bolder.  "For an excipient  in manipulating a pill mass which do you prefer - the magnesia  carbonate or the pulverised glycerrhiza radix?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The - er - magnesia," I said.  It was easier to say than the other  word. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Mr. Bolder glanced at me distrustfully through his spectacles. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Give me the glycerrhiza," said he.  "Magnesia cakes." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Here's another one of these fake aphasia cases," he said,  presently, handing me his newspaper, and laying his finger upon  an article.  "I don't believe in 'em.  I put nine out of ten of 'em  down as frauds.  A man gets sick of his business and his folks and  wants to have a good time.  He skips out somewhere, and when  they find him he pretends to have lost his memory - don't know his  own name, and won't even recognize the strawberry mark on his  wife's left shoulder.  Aphasia!  Tut!  Why can't they stay at home  and forget?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I took the paper and read, after the pungent headlines, the  following: </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "DENVER, June 12. - Elwyn C. Belford, a prominent lawyer, is  mysteriously missing from his home since three days ago, and all  efforts to locate him have been in vain.  Mr. Bellford is a well-known citizen of the highest standing, and has enjoyed a large and  lucrative law practice.  He is married and owns a fine home and  the most extensive private library in the State.  On the day of his  disappearance, he drew quite a large sum of money from his bank.   No one can be found who saw him after he left the bank.  Mr. Bellford  was a man of singularly quiet and domestic tastes, and seemed to find  his happiness in his home and profession.  If any clue at all exists  to his strange disappearance, it my be found in the fact that  for some months he has been deeply absorbed in an important law case  in connection with the Q. Y. and Z. Railroad Company.  It is feared  that overwork may have affected his mind.  Every effort is being made  to discover the whereabouts of the missing man." </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "It seems to me you are not altogether uncynical, Mr. Bolder,"  I said, after I had read the despatch.  "This has the sound, to me,  of a genuine case.  Why should this man, prosperous, happily  married, and respected, choose suddenly to abandon everything?   I know that these lapses of memory do occur, and that men do find  themselves adrift without a name, a history or a home." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Oh, gammon and jalap!" said Mr. Bolder.  "It's larks they're after.   There's too much education nowadays.  Men know about aphasia,  and they use it for an excuse.  The women are wise, too.  When it's  all over they look you in the eye, as scientific as you please, and  say:  'He hypnotized me.'" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Thus Mr. Bolder diverted, but did not aid, me with his comments  and philosophy. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        We arrived in New York about ten at night.  I rode in a cab to a  hotel, and I wrote my name "Edward Pinkhammer" in the register.   As I did so I felt pervade me a splendid, wild, intoxicating  buoyancy - a sense of unlimited freedom, of newly attained  possibilities.  I was just born into the world.  The old fetters -  whatever they had been - were stricken from my hands and feet.   The future lay before me a clear road such as an infant enters,  and I could set out upon it equipped with a man's learning  and experience. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I thought the hotel clerk looked at me five seconds too long.  I had  no baggage. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The Druggists' Convention,"  I said.  "My trunk has somehow  failed to arrive."  I drew out a roll of money. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Ah!" said he, showing an auriferous tooth, "we have quite a number  of the Western delegates stopping here."  He struck a bell  for the boy. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I endeavored to give color to my role. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "There is an important movement on foot among us Westerners," I  said, "in regard to a recommendation to the convention that the  bottles containing the tartrate of antimoney and potash, and the  tartrate of sodium and potash be kept in a contiguous position on  the shelf." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Gentleman to three-fourteen," said the clerk, hastily.  I was  whisked away to my room. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The next day I bought a trunk and clothing, and began to live  the life of Edward Pinkhammer.  I did not tax my brain with  endeavors to solve problems of the past. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        It was a piquant and sparkling cup that the great island city held  up to my lips.  I drank of it gratefully.  The keys of Manhattan  belong to him who is able to bear them.  You must be either the  city's guest or its victim. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The following few days were as gold and silver.  Edward  Pinkhammer, yet counting back to his birth by hours only, knew  the rare joy of having come upon so diverting a world full-fledged  and unrestrained.  I sat entranced on the magic carpets provided in  theatres and roof-gardens, that transported one into strange and  delightful lands full of frolicsome music, pretty girls and grotesque  drolly extravagant parodies upon human kind.  I went here and  there at my own dear will, bound by no limits of space, time or  comportment.  I dined in weird cabarets, at weirder <i>tables  d'hote</i> to the sound of Hungarian music and the wild shouts of  mercurial artists and sculptors.  Or, again, where the night life  quivers in the electric glare like a kinetoscopic picture, and the  millinery of the world, and its jewels, and the ones whom they  adorn, and the men who make all three possible are met for good  cheer and the spectacular effect.  And among all these scenes that I  have mentioned I learned one thing that I never knew before.  And  that is that the key to liberty is not in the hands of License, but  Convention holds it.  Comity has a toll-gate at which you must  pay, or you may not enter the land of Freedom.  In all the glitter,  the seeming disorder, the parade, the abandon, I saw this law,  unobtrusive, yet like iron, prevail.  Therefore, in Manhattan you  must obey these unwritten laws, and then you will be freest of the  free.  If you decline to be bound by them, you put on shackles. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Sometimes, as my mood urged me, I would seek the stately, softly  murmuring palm rooms, redolent with high-born life and delicate  restraint, in which to dine.  Again I would go down to the  waterways in steamers packed with vociferous, bedecked,  unchecked love-making clerks and shop-girls to their crude  pleasures on the island shores.  And there was always Broadway -  glistening, opulent, wily, varying, desirable Broadway - growing  upon one like an opium habit. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        One afternoon as I entered my hotel a stout man with a big nose  and a black mustache blocked my way in the corridor.  When I  would have passed around him, he greet me with offensive  familiarity. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Hello, Bellford!" he cried, loudly.  "What the deuce are you doing  in New York?  Didn't know anything could drag you away from  that old book den of yours.  Is Mrs. B. along or is this a little  business run alone, eh?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "You have made a mistake, sir," I said, coldly, releasing my hand  from his grasp.  "My name is Pinkhammer.  You will excuse me." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The man dropped to one side, apparently astonished.  As I walked  to the clerk's desk I heard him call to a bell boy and say something  about telegraph blanks. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "You will give me my bill," I said to the clerk, "and have my  baggage brought down in half an hour.  I do not care to remain  where I am annoyed by confidence men." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I moved that afternoon to another hotel, a sedate, old-fashioned  one on lower Fifth Avenue. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        There was a restaurant a little way off Broadway where one could  be served almost <i>al fresco</i> in a tropic array of screening flora.   Quiet and luxury and a perfect service made it an ideal place in  which to take luncheon or refreshment.  One afternoon I was there  picking my way to a table among the ferns when I felt my sleeve  caught. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Mr. Bellford!" exclaimed an amazingly sweet voice. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I turned quickly to see a lady seated alone - a lady of about thirty,  with exceedingly handsome eyes, who looked at me as though I  had been her very dear friend. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "You were about to pass me," she said, accusingly.  "Don't tell me  you do not know me.  Why should we not shake hands - at least  once in fifteen years?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I shook hands with her at once.  I took a chair opposite her at the  table.  I summoned with my eyebrows a hovering waiter.  The lady  was philandering with an orange ice.  I ordered a <i>creme de  menthe</i>.  Her hair was reddish bronze.  You could not look at it,  because you could not look away from her eyes.  But you were  conscious of it as you are conscious of sunset while you look into  the profundities of a wood at twilight. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Are you sure you know me?" I asked. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "No," she said, smiling.  "I was never sure of that." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "What would you think," I said, a little anxiously, "if I were  to tell you that my name is Edward Pinkhammer, from Cornopolis,  Kansas?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "What would I think?" she repeated, with a merry glance.  "Why,  that you had not brought Mrs. Bellford to New York with you, of  course.  I do wish you had.  I would have liked to see Marian."   Her voice lowered slightly - "You haven't changed much, Elwyn." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I felt her wonderful eyes searching mine and my face more closely. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Yes, you have," she amended, and there was a soft, exultant note  in her latest tones; "I see it now.  You haven't forgotten.  You  haven't forgotten for a year or a day or an hour.  I told you you  never could." </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I poked my straw anxiously in the <i>creme de menthe</i>. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I'm sure I beg your pardon," I said, a little uneasy at her gaze.   "But that is just the trouble.  I have forgotten.  I've forgotten  everything." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        She flouted my denial.  She laughed deliciously at something she  seemed to see in my face. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I've heard of you at times," she went on.  "You're quite a big  lawyer out West - Denver, isn't it, or Los Angeles?  Marian must be  very proud of you.  You knew, I suppose, that I married six months  after you did.  You may have seen it in the papers.  The flowers  alone cost two thousand dollars." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        She had mentioned fifteen years.  Fifteen years is a long time. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Would it be too late," I asked, somewhat timorously, "to offer you  congratulations?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Not if you dare do it," she answered, with such fine intrepidity  that I was silent, and began to crease patterns on the cloth with  my thumb nail. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Tell me one thing," she said, leaning toward me rather eagerly -  "a thing I have wanted to know for many years - just from a woman's  curiosity, of course - have you ever dared since that night to touch,  smell or look at white roses - at white roses wet with rain and  dew?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I took a sip of <i>creme de menthe</i>. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "It would be useless, I suppose," I said, with a sigh, "for me to  repeat that I have no recollection at all about these things.  My  memory is completely at fault.  I need not say how much I regret  it." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The lady rested her arms upon the table, and again her eyes  disdained my words and went traveling by their own route direct  to my soul.  She laughed softly, with a strange quality in the  sound - it was a laugh of happiness - yes, and of content - and of  misery.  I tried to look away from her. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "You lie, Elwyn Bellford," she breathed, blissfully.  "Oh, I know  you lie!" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I gazed dully into the ferns. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "My name is Edward Pinkhammer," I said.  "I came with the  delegates to the Druggists' National Convention.  There is a  movement on foot for arranging a new position for the bottles of  tartrate of antimony and tartrate of potash, in which, very likely,  you would take little interest." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        A shining landau stopped before the entrance.  The lady rose.  I  took her hand, and bowed. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I am deeply sorry," I said to her, "that I cannot remember.  I could  explain, but fear you would not understand.  You will not concede  Pinkhammer; and I really cannot at all conceive of the - the roses  and other things." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Good-by, Mr. Bellford," she said, with her happy, sorrowful  smile, as she stepped into her carriage. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I attended the theatre that night.  When I returned to my hotel,  a quiet man in dark clothes, who seemed interested in rubbing his  finger nails with a silk handkerchief, appeared, magically, at my  side. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Mr. Pinkhammer," he said, giving the bulk of his attention to his  forefinger, "may I request you to step aside with me for a little  conversation?  There is a room here." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Certainly," I answered. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He conducted me into a small, private parlor.  A lady and a  gentleman were there.  The lady, I surmised, would have been  unusually good-looking had her features not been clouded by an  expression of keen worry and fatigue.  She was of a style of figure  and possessed coloring and features that were agreeable to my  fancy.  She was in a traveling dress; she fixed upon me an earnest  look of extreme anxiety, and pressed an unsteady hand to her  bosom.  I think she would have started forward, but the gentleman  arrested her movement with an authoritative motion of his hand.   He then came, himself, to meet me.  He was a man of forty, a little  gray about the temples, and with a strong, thoughtful face. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Bellford, old man," he said, cordially, "I'm glad to see you again.   Of course we know everything is all right.  I warned you, you  know, that you were overdoing it.  Now, you'll go back with us,  and be yourself again in no time." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I smiled ironically. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I have been 'Bellforded' so often," I said, "that it has lost its  edge.  Still, in the end, it may grow wearisome.  Would you be  willing at all to entertain the hypothesis that my name is Edward  Pinkhammer, and that I never saw you before in my life?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Before the man could reply a wailing cry came from the woman.   She sprang past his detaining arm.  "Elwyn!" she sobbed, and cast  herself upon me, and clung tight.  "Elwyn," she cried again, "don't  break my heart.  I am your wife - call my name once - just once.  I  could see you dead rather than this way." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I unwound her arms respectfully, but firmly. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Madam," I said, severely, "pardon me if I suggest that you accept  a resemblance too precipitately.  It is a pity," I went on, with an  amused laugh, as the thought occurred to me, "that this Bellford  and I could not be kept side by side upon the same shelf like  tartrates of sodium and antimony for purposes of identification.   In order to understand the allusion," I concluded airily, "it may  be necessary for you to keep an eye on the proceedings of the  Druggists' National Convention." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The lady turned to her companion, and grasped his arm. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "What is it, Doctor Volney?  Oh, what is it?" she moaned. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Go to your room for a while," I heard him say.  "I will remain and  talk with him.  His mind?  No, I think not - only a portion of the  brain.  Yes, I am sure he will recover.  Go to your room and leave  me with him." </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The lady disappeared.  The man in dark clothes also went outside,  still manicuring himself in a thoughtful way.  I think he waited  in the hall. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I would like to talk with you a while, Mr. Pinkhammer, if I may,"  said the gentleman who remained. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Very well, if you care to," I replied, "and will excuse me if I take  it comfortably; I am rather tired."  I stretched myself upon a couch  by a window and lit a cigar.  He drew a chair nearby. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Let us speak to the point," he said, soothingly.  "Your name is not  Pinkhammer." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I know that as well as you do," I said, coolly.  "But a man  must have a name of some sort.  I can assure you that I do not  extravagantly admire the name of Pinkhammer.  But when one  christens one's self suddenly, the fine names do not seem to  suggest themselves.  But, suppose it had been Scheringhausen  or Scroggins!  I think I did very well with Pinkhammer." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Your name," said the other man, seriously, "is Elwyn C. Bellford.   You are one of the first lawyers in Denver.  You are suffering from  an attack of aphasia, which has caused you to forget your identity.   The cause of it was over-application to your profession, and,  perhaps, a life too bare of natural recreation and pleasures.  The  lady who has just left the room is your wife." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "She is what I would call a fine-looking woman," I said, after a  judicial pause.  "I particularly admire the shade of brown in her  hair." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "She is a wife to be proud of.  Since your disappearance, nearly  two weeks ago, she has scarcely closed her eyes.  We learned that  you were in New York through a telegram sent by Isidore Newman,  a traveling man from Denver.  He said that he had met you in a  hotel here, and that you did not recognize him." </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I think I remember the occasion," I said.  "The fellow called me  'Bellford,' if I am not mistaken.  But don't you think it about time,  now, for you to introduce yourself?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I am Robert Volney - Doctor Volney.  I have been your close friend  for twenty years, and your physician for fifteen.  I came with  Mrs. Bellford to trace you as soon as we got the telegram.  Try,  Elwyn, old man - try to remember!" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "What's the use to try?" I asked, with a little frown.  "You say you  are a physician.  Is aphasia curable?  When a man loses his memory  does it return slowly, or suddenly?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Sometimes gradually and imperfectly; sometimes as suddenly as  it went." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Will you undertake the treatment of my case, Doctor Volney?" I  asked. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Old friend," said he, "I'll do everything in my power, and will have  done everything that science can do to cure you." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Very well," said I.  "Then you will consider that I am your patient.   Everything is in confidence now - professional confidence." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Of course," said Doctor Volney. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I got up from the couch.  Some one had set a vase of white roses  on the centre table - a cluster of white roses, freshly sprinkled and  fragrant.  I threw them far out of the window, and then laid myself  upon the couch again. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "It will be best, Bobby," I said, "to have this cure happen suddenly.   I'm rather tired of it all, anyway.  You may go now and bring Marian  in.  But, oh, Doc," I said, with a sigh, as I kicked him on the shin  - "good old Doc - it was glorious!"</div>
