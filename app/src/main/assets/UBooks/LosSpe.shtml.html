<div class="story_text" id="1"><p>The confession of Herbert de Lernac, now lying under sentence of  death at Marseilles, has thrown a light upon one of the most  inexplicable crimes of the century - an incident which is, I  believe, absolutely unprecedented in the criminal annals of any  country. Although there is a reluctance to discuss the matter in  official circles, and little information has been given to the  Press, there are still indications that the statement of this  arch-criminal is corroborated by the facts, and that we have at  last found a solution for a most astounding business.  As the  matter is eight years old, and as its importance was somewhat  obscured by a political crisis which was engaging the public  attention at the time, it may be as well to state the facts as  far as we have been able to ascertain them.  They are collated  from the Liverpool papers of that date, from the proceedings at  the inquest upon John Slater, the engine-driver, and from the  records of the London and West Coast Railway Company, which  have been courteously put at my disposal.  Briefly, they are as  follows: </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        On the 3rd of June, 1890, a gentleman, who gave his name as  Monsieur Louis Caratal, desired an interview with Mr. James Bland,  the superintendent of the London and West Coast Central Station in  Liverpool.  He was a small man, middle-aged and dark, with a stoop  which was so marked that it suggested some deformity of the spine.   He was accompanied by a friend, a man of imposing physique, whose  deferential manner and constant attention showed that his position  was one of dependence.  This friend or companion, whose name did  not transpire, was certainly a foreigner, and probably from his  swarthy complexion, either a Spaniard or a South American.  One  peculiarity was observed in him.  He carried in his left hand a  small black, leather dispatch box, and it was noticed by a sharp-eyed clerk in the Central office that this box was fastened to  his wrist by a strap.  No importance was attached to the fact at  the time, but subsequent events endowed it with some significance.   Monsieur Caratal was shown up to Mr. Bland's office, while his  companion remained outside. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Monsieur Caratal's business was quickly dispatched.  He had  arrived that afternoon from Central America.  Affairs of the utmost  importance demanded that he should be in Paris without the loss of  an unnecessary hour.  He had missed the London express.  A special  must be provided.  Money was of no importance.  Time was  everything.  If the company would speed him on his way, they might  make their own terms. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Mr. Bland struck the electric bell, summoned Mr. Potter Hood,  the traffic manager, and had the matter arranged in five minutes.   The train would start in three-quarters of an hour.  It would take  that time to insure that the line should be clear.  The powerful  engine called Rochdale (No. 247 on the company's register) was  attached to two carriages, with a guard's van behind.  The first  carriage was solely for the purpose of decreasing the inconvenience  arising from the oscillation.  The second was divided, as usual,  into four compartments, a first-class, a first-class smoking, a  second-class, and a second-class smoking.  The first compartment,  which was nearest to the engine, was the one allotted to the  travellers.  The other three were empty.  The guard of the special  train was James McPherson, who had been some years in the service  of the company.  The stoker, William Smith, was a new hand. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Monsieur Caratal, upon leaving the superintendent's office,  rejoined his companion, and both of them manifested extreme  impatience to be off.  Having paid the money asked, which amounted  to fifty pounds five shillings, at the usual special rate of five  shillings a mile, they demanded to be shown the carriage, and at  once took their seats in it, although they were assured that the  better part of an hour must elapse before the line could be  cleared.  In the meantime a singular coincidence had occurred in  the office which Monsieur Caratal had just quitted. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        A request for a special is not a very uncommon circumstance in  a rich commercial centre, but that two should be required upon the  same afternoon was most unusual.  It so happened, however,  that Mr. Bland had hardly dismissed the first traveller before a  second entered with a similar request.  This was a Mr. Horace  Moore, a gentlemanly man of military appearance, who alleged that  the sudden serious illness of his wife in London made it absolutely  imperative that he should not lose an instant in starting upon the  journey.  His distress and anxiety were so evident that Mr. Bland  did all that was possible to meet his wishes.  A second special was  out of the question, as the ordinary local service was already  somewhat deranged by the first.  There was the alternative,  however, that Mr. Moore should share the expense of Monsieur  Caratal's train, and should travel in the other empty first-class  compartment, if Monsieur Caratal objected to having him in the one  which he occupied.  It was difficult to see any objection to such  an arrangement, and yet Monsieur Caratal, upon the suggestion being  made to him by Mr. Potter Hood, absolutely refused to consider it  for an instant.  The train was his, he said, and he would insist  upon the exclusive use of it.  All argument failed to overcome his  ungracious objections, and finally the plan had to be abandoned.   Mr. Horace Moore left the station in great distress, after learning  that his only course was to take the ordinary slow train which  leaves Liverpool at six o'clock.  At four thirty-one exactly by the  station clock the special train, containing the crippled Monsieur  Caratal and his gigantic companion, steamed out of the Liverpool  station.  The line was at that time clear, and there should have  been no stoppage before Manchester. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The trains of the London and West Coast Railway run over the  lines of another company as far as this town, which should have  been reached by the special rather before six o'clock.  At a  quarter after six considerable surprise and some consternation were  caused amongst the officials at Liverpool by the receipt of a  telegram from Manchester to say that it had not yet arrived.  An  inquiry directed to St. Helens, which is a third of the way between  the two cities, elicited the following reply -  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "To James Bland, Superintendent, Central L. & W. C.,  Liverpool. - Special passed here at 4:52, well up to time. - Dowster,  St. Helens." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        This telegram was received at six-forty.  At six-fifty a second  message was received from Manchester -  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "No sign of special as advised by you." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And then ten minutes later a third, more bewildering -  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Presume some mistake as to proposed running of special.  Local  train from St. Helens timed to follow it has just arrived and has  seen nothing of it.  Kindly wire advices. - Manchester." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The matter was assuming a most amazing aspect, although in some  respects the last telegram was a relief to the authorities at  Liverpool.  If an accident had occurred to the special, it seemed  hardly possible that the local train could have passed down the  same line without observing it.  And yet, what was the alternative?   Where could the train be?  Had it possibly been sidetracked for  some reason in order to allow the slower train to go past?  Such an  explanation was possible if some small repair had to be effected.   A telegram was dispatched to each of the stations between St.  Helens and Manchester, and the superintendent and traffic manager  waited in the utmost suspense at the instrument for the series of  replies which would enable them to say for certain what had become  of the missing train.  The answers came back in the order of  questions, which was the order of the stations beginning at the St.  Helens end -  </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Special passed here five o'clock. - Collins Green." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Special passed here six past five. - Earlstown." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Special passed here 5:10. - Newton." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Special passed here 5:20. - Kenyon Junction." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "No special train has passed here. - Barton Moss." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The two officials stared at each other in amazement. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "This is unique in my thirty years of experience," said Mr.  Bland. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Absolutely unprecedented and inexplicable, sir.  The special  has gone wrong between Kenyon Junction and Barton Moss." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "And yet there is no siding, so far as my memory serves me,  between the two stations.  The special must have run off the  metals." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "But how could the four-fifty parliamentary pass over the same  line without observing it?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "There's no alternative, Mr. Hood.  It must be so.   Possibly the local train may have observed something which may  throw some light upon the matter.  We will wire to Manchester for  more information, and to Kenyon Junction with instructions that the  line be examined instantly as far as Barton Moss."  The answer from Manchester came within a few minutes. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "No news of missing special.  Driver and guard of slow train  positive no accident between Kenyon Junction and Barton Moss.  Line quite clear, and no sign of anything unusual. - Manchester." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "That driver and guard will have to go," said Mr. Bland,  grimly.  "There has been a wreck and they have missed it.  The  special has obviously run off the metals without disturbing the  line - how it could have done so passes my comprehension - but so it  must be, and we shall have a wire from Kenyon or Barton Moss  presently to say that they have found her at the bottom of an  embankment." </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        But Mr. Bland's prophecy was not destined to be fulfilled.   Half an hour passed, and then there arrived the following message  from the station-master of Kenyon Junction -  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "There are no traces of the missing special.  It is quite  certain that she passed here, and that she did not arrive at Barton  Moss.  We have detached engine from goods train, and I have myself  ridden down the line, but all is clear, and there is no sign of any  accident." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Mr. Bland tore his hair in his perplexity. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "This is rank lunacy, Hood!" he cried.  "Does a train vanish  into thin air in England in broad daylight?  The thing is  preposterous.  An engine, a tender, two carriages, a van, five  human beings - and all lost on a straight line of railway!  Unless  we get something positive within the next hour I'll take Inspector  Collins, and go down myself." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And then at last something positive did occur.  It took the  shape of another telegram from Kenyon Junction. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Regret to report that the dead body of John Slater, driver of  the special train, has just been found among the gorse bushes at a  point two and a quarter miles from the Junction.  Had fallen from  his engine, pitched down the embankment, and rolled among the  bushes.  Injuries to his head, from the fall, appear to be cause of  death.  Ground has now been carefully examined, and there is no  trace of the missing train." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The country was, as has already been stated, in the throes of  a political crisis, and the attention of the public was  further distracted by the important and sensational developments in  Paris, where a huge scandal threatened to destroy the Government  and to wreck the reputations of many of the leading men in France.   The papers were full of these events, and the singular  disappearance of the special train attracted less attention than  would have been the case in more peaceful times.  The grotesque  nature of the event helped to detract from its importance, for the  papers were disinclined to believe the facts as reported to them.   More than one of the London journals treated the matter as an  ingenious hoax, until the coroner's inquest upon the unfortunate  driver (an inquest which elicited nothing of importance) convinced  them of the tragedy of the incident. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Mr. Bland, accompanied by Inspector Collins, the senior  detective officer in the service of the company, went down to  Kenyon Junction the same evening, and their research lasted  throughout the following day, but was attended with purely negative  results.  Not only was no trace found of the missing train, but no  conjecture could be put forward which could possibly explain the  facts.  At the same time, Inspector Collins's official report  (which lies before me as I write) served to show that the  possibilities were more numerous than might have been expected. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "In the stretch of railway between these two points," said he,  "the country is dotted with ironworks and collieries.  Of these,  some are being worked and some have been abandoned.  There are no  fewer than twelve which have small-gauge lines which run trolly-cars down to the main line.  These can, of course, be disregarded.   Besides these, however, there are seven which have, or have had,  proper lines running down and connecting with points to the main  line, so as to convey their produce from the mouth of the mine to  the great centres of distribution.  In every case these lines are  only a few miles in length.  Out of the seven, four belong to  collieries which are worked out, or at least to shafts which are no  longer used.  These are the Redgauntlet, Hero, Slough of Despond,  and Heartsease mines, the latter having ten years ago been one of  the principal mines in Lancashire.  These four side lines may be  eliminated from our inquiry, for, to prevent possible accidents,  the rails nearest to the main line have been taken up, and  there is no longer any connection.  There remain three other side  lines leading -  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        (a) To the Carnstock Iron Works;  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        (b) To the Big Ben Colliery;  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        (c) To the Perseverance Colliery. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Of these the Big Ben line is not more than a quarter of a mile  long, and ends at a dead wall of coal waiting removal from the  mouth of the mine.  Nothing had been seen or heard there of any  special.  The Carnstock Iron Works line was blocked all day upon  the 3rd of June by sixteen truckloads of hematite.  It is a single  line, and nothing could have passed.  As to the Perseverance line,  it is a large double line, which does a considerable traffic, for  the output of the mine is very large.  On the 3rd of June this  traffic proceeded as usual; hundreds of men including a gang of  railway platelayers were working along the two miles and a quarter  which constitute the total length of the line, and it is  inconceivable that an unexpected train could have come down there  without attracting universal attention.  It may be remarked in  conclusion that this branch line is nearer to St. Helens than the  point at which the engine-driver was discovered, so that we have  every reason to believe that the train was past that point before  misfortune overtook her. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "As to John Slater, there is no clue to be gathered from his  appearance or injuries.  We can only say that, so far as we can  see, he met his end by falling off his engine, though why he fell,  or what became of the engine after his fall, is a question upon  which I do not feel qualified to offer an opinion."  In conclusion,  the inspector offered his resignation to the Board, being much  nettled by an accusation of incompetence in the London papers. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        A month elapsed, during which both the police and the company  prosecuted their inquiries without the slightest success.  A reward  was offered and a pardon promised in case of crime, but they were  both unclaimed.  Every day the public opened their papers with the  conviction that so grotesque a mystery would at last be solved, but  week after week passed by, and a solution remained as far off as  ever.  In broad daylight, upon a June afternoon in the most thickly  inhabited portion of England, a train with its occupants had  disappeared as completely as if some master of subtle chemistry had  volatilized it into gas.  Indeed, among the various conjectures  which were put forward in the public Press, there were some which  seriously asserted that supernatural, or, at least, preternatural,  agencies had been at work, and that the deformed Monsieur Caratal  was probably a person who was better known under a less polite  name.  Others fixed upon his swarthy companion as being the author  of the mischief, but what it was exactly which he had done could  never be clearly formulated in words. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Amongst the many suggestions put forward by various newspapers  or private individuals, there were one or two which were feasible  enough to attract the attention of the public.  One which appeared  in The Times, over the signature of an amateur reasoner of some  celebrity at that date, attempted to deal with the matter in a  critical and semi-scientific manner.  An extract must suffice,  although the curious can see the whole letter in the issue of the  3rd of July. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "It is one of the elementary principles of practical  reasoning," he remarked, "that when the impossible has been  eliminated the residuum, HOWEVER IMPROBABLE, must contain the  truth.  It is certain that the train left Kenyon Junction.  It is  certain that it did not reach Barton Moss.  It is in the highest  degree unlikely, but still possible, that it may have taken one of  the seven available side lines.  It is obviously impossible for a  train to run where there are no rails, and, therefore, we may  reduce our improbables to the three open lines, namely the  Carnstock Iron Works, the Big Ben, and the Perserverance.  Is there  a secret society of colliers, an English Camorra, which is  capable of destroying both train and passengers?  It is improbable,  but it is not impossible.  I confess that I am unable to suggest  any other solution.  I should certainly advise the company to  direct all their energies towards the observation of those three  lines, and of the workmen at the end of them.  A careful  supervision of the pawnbrokers' shops of the district might  possibly bring some suggestive facts to light." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The suggestion coming from a recognized authority upon such  matters created considerable interest, and a fierce opposition from  those who considered such a statement to be a preposterous  libel upon an honest and deserving set of men.  The only  answer to this criticism was a challenge to the objectors to lay  any more feasible explanations before the public.  In reply to this  two others were forthcoming (Times, July 7th and 9th).  The  first suggested that the train might have run off the metals and be  lying submerged in the Lancashire and Staffordshire Canal, which  runs parallel to the railway for some hundred of yards.  This  suggestion was thrown out of court by the published depth of the  canal, which was entirely insufficient to conceal so large an  object.  The second correspondent wrote calling attention to the  bag which appeared to be the sole luggage which the travellers had  brought with them, and suggesting that some novel explosive of  immense and pulverizing power might have been concealed in it.  The  obvious absurdity, however, of supposing that the whole train might  be blown to dust while the metals remained uninjured reduced any  such explanation to a farce.  The investigation had drifted into  this hopeless position when a new and most unexpected incident  occurred. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        This was nothing less than the receipt by Mrs. McPherson of a  letter from her husband, James McPherson, who had been the guard on  the missing train.  The letter, which was dated July 5th, 1890, was  posted from New York and came to hand upon July 14th.  Some doubts  were expressed as to its genuine character but Mrs. McPherson was  positive as to the writing, and the fact that it contained a  remittance of a hundred dollars in five-dollar notes was enough in  itself to discount the idea of a hoax.  No address was given in the  letter, which ran in this way: </p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote>MY DEAR WIFE, -  <BR>       "I have been thinking a great deal, and I find it very hard to  give you up.  The same with Lizzie.  I try to fight against it, but  it will always come back to me.  I send you some money which will  change into twenty English pounds.  This should be enough to bring  both Lizzie and you across the Atlantic, and you will find the  Hamburg boats which stop at Southampton very good boats, and  cheaper than Liverpool.  If you could come here and stop at the  Johnston House I would try and send you word how to meet, but  things are very difficult with me at present, and I am not  very happy, finding it hard to give you both up.  So no more at  present, from your loving husband, <BR>       "James McPherson."</blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a time it was confidently anticipated that this letter  would lead to the clearing up of the whole matter, the more so as  it was ascertained that a passenger who bore a close resemblance to  the missing guard had travelled from Southampton under the name of  Summers in the Hamburg and New York liner Vistula, which  started upon the 7th of June.  Mrs. McPherson and her sister Lizzie  Dolton went across to New York as directed and stayed for three  weeks at the Johnston House, without hearing anything from the  missing man.  It is probable that some injudicious comments in the  Press may have warned him that the police were using them as a  bait.  However, this may be, it is certain that he neither wrote  nor came, and the women were eventually compelled to return to  Liverpool. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And so the matter stood, and has continued to stand up to the  present year of 1898.  Incredible as it may seem, nothing has  transpired during these eight years which has shed the least light  upon the extraordinary disappearance of the special train which  contained Monsieur Caratal and his companion.  Careful inquiries  into the antecedents of the two travellers have only established  the fact that Monsieur Caratal was well known as a financier and  political agent in Central America, and that during his voyage to  Europe he had betrayed extraordinary anxiety to reach Paris.  His  companion, whose name was entered upon the passenger lists as  Eduardo Gomez, was a man whose record was a violent one, and whose  reputation was that of a bravo and a bully.  There was evidence to  show, however, that he was honestly devoted to the interests of  Monsieur Caratal, and that the latter, being a man of puny  physique, employed the other as a guard and protector.  It may be  added that no information came from Paris as to what the objects of  Monsieur Caratal's hurried journey may have been.  This comprises  all the facts of the case up to the publication in the Marseilles  papers of the recent confession of Herbert de Lernac, now under  sentence of death for the murder of a merchant named Bonvalot.   This statement may be literally translated as follows: </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "It is not out of mere pride or boasting that I give this  information, for, if that were my object, I could tell a dozen  actions of mine which are quite as splendid; but I do it in order  that certain gentlemen in Paris may understand that I, who am able  here to tell about the fate of Monsieur Caratal, can also tell in  whose interest and at whose request the deed was done, unless the  reprieve which I am awaiting comes to me very quickly.  Take  warning, messieurs, before it is too late!  You know Herbert de  Lernac, and you are aware that his deeds are as ready as his words.   Hasten then, or you are lost! </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "At present I shall mention no names - if you only heard the  names, what would you not think! - but I shall merely tell you how  cleverly I did it.  I was true to my employers then, and no doubt  they will be true to me now.  I hope so, and until I am convinced  that they have betrayed me, these names, which would convulse  Europe, shall not be divulged.  But on that day . . . well, I say  no more! </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "In a word, then, there was a famous trial in Paris, in the  year 1890, in connection with a monstrous scandal in politics and  finance.  How monstrous that scandal was can never be known save by  such confidential agents as myself.  The honour and careers of many  of the chief men in France were at stake.  You have seen a group of  ninepins standing, all so rigid, and prim, and unbending.  Then  there comes the ball from far away and pop, pop, pop - there are  your ninepins on the floor.  Well, imagine some of the greatest men  in France as these ninepins and then this Monsieur Caratal was the  ball which could be seen coming from far away.  If he arrived, then  it was pop, pop, pop for all of them.  It was determined that he  should not arrive. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I do not accuse them all of being conscious of what was to  happen.  There were, as I have said, great financial as well as  political interests at stake, and a syndicate was formed to manage  the business.  Some subscribed to the syndicate who hardly  understood what were its objects.  But others understood very well,  and they can rely upon it that I have not forgotten their names.   They had ample warning that Monsieur Caratal was coming long before  he left South America, and they knew that the evidence which he  held would certainly mean ruin to all of them.  The syndicate had  the command of an unlimited amount of money - absolutely  unlimited, you understand.  They looked round for an agent who was  capable of wielding this gigantic power.  The man chosen must be  inventive, resolute, adaptive - a man in a million.  They chose  Herbert de Lernac, and I admit that they were right. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "My duties were to choose my subordinates, to use freely the  power which money gives, and to make certain that Monsieur Caratal  should never arrive in Paris.  With characteristic energy I set  about my commission within an hour of receiving my instructions,  and the steps which I took were the very best for the purpose which  could possibly be devised. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "A man whom I could trust was dispatched instantly to South  America to travel home with Monsieur Caratal.  Had he arrived in  time the ship would never have reached Liverpool; but alas! it had  already started before my agent could reach it.  I fitted out a  small armed brig to intercept it, but again I was unfortunate.   Like all great organizers I was, however, prepared for failure, and  had a series of alternatives prepared, one or the other of which  must succeed.  You must not underrate the difficulties of my  undertaking, or imagine that a mere commonplace assassination would  meet the case.  We must destroy not only Monsieur Caratal, but  Monsieur Caratal's documents, and Monsieur Caratal's companions  also, if we had reason to believe that he had communicated his  secrets to them.  And you must remember that they were on the  alert, and keenly suspicious of any such attempt.  It was a task  which was in every way worthy of me, for I am always most masterful  where another would be appalled. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I was all ready for Monsieur Caratal's reception in Liverpool,  and I was the more eager because I had reason to believe that he  had made arrangements by which he would have a considerable guard  from the moment that he arrived in London.  Anything which was to  be done must be done between the moment of his setting foot upon  the Liverpool quay and that of his arrival at the London and West  Coast terminus in London.  We prepared six plans, each more  elaborate than the last; which plan would be used would depend upon  his own movements.  Do what he would, we were ready for him.  If he  had stayed in Liverpool, we were ready.  If he took an ordinary  train, an express, or a special, all was ready.  Everything had  been foreseen and provided for. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "You may imagine that I could not do all this myself.  What  could I know of the English railway lines?  But money can  procure willing agents all the world over, and I soon had one of  the acutest brains in England to assist me.  I will mention no  names, but it would be unjust to claim all the credit for myself.   My English ally was worthy of such an alliance.  He knew the London  and West Coast line thoroughly, and he had the command of a band of  workers who were trustworthy and intelligent.  The idea was his,  and my own judgement was only required in the details.  We bought  over several officials, amongst whom the most important was James  McPherson, whom we had ascertained to be the guard most likely to  be employed upon a special train.  Smith, the stoker, was also in  our employ.  John Slater, the engine-driver, had been approached,  but had been found to be obstinate and dangerous, so we desisted.   We had no certainty that Monsieur Caratal would take a special, but  we thought it very probable, for it was of the utmost importance to  him that he should reach Paris without delay.  It was for this  contingency, therefore, that we made special preparations - preparations which were complete down to the last detail long  before his steamer had sighted the shores of England.  You will be  amused to learn that there was one of my agents in the pilot-boat  which brought that steamer to its moorings. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The moment that Caratal arrived in Liverpool we knew that he  suspected danger and was on his guard.  He had brought with him as  an escort a dangerous fellow, named Gomez, a man who carried  weapons, and was prepared to use them.  This fellow carried  Caratal's confidential papers for him, and was ready to protect  either them or his master.  The probability was that Caratal had  taken him into his counsels, and that to remove Caratal without  removing Gomez would be a mere waste of energy.  It was necessary  that they should be involved in a common fate, and our plans to  that end were much facilitated by their request for a special  train.  On that special train you will understand that two out of  the three servants of the company were really in our employ, at a  price which would make them independent for a lifetime.  I do not  go so far as to say that the English are more honest than any other  nation, but I have found them more expensive to buy. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I have already spoken of my English agent - who is a man  with a considerable future before him, unless some complaint  of the throat carries him off before his time.  He had charge of  all arrangements at Liverpool, whilst I was stationed at the inn at  Kenyon, where I awaited a cipher signal to act.  When the special  was arranged for, my agent instantly telegraphed to me and warned  me how soon I should have everything ready.  He himself under the  name of Horace Moore applied immediately for a special also, in the  hope that he would be sent down with Monsieur Caratal, which might  under certain circumstances have been helpful to us.  If, for  example, our great coup had failed, it would then have become the  duty of my agent to have shot them both and destroyed their papers.   Caratal was on his guard, however, and refused to admit any other  traveller.  My agent then left the station, returned by another  entrance, entered the guard's van on the side farthest from the  platform, and travelled down with McPherson the guard. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "In the meantime you will be interested to know what my  movements were.  Everything had been prepared for days before, and  only the finishing touches were needed.  The side line which we had  chosen had once joined the main line, but it had been disconnected.   We had only to replace a few rails to connect it once more.  These  rails had been laid down as far as could be done without danger of  attracting attention, and now it was merely a case of completing a  juncture with the line, and arranging the points as they had been  before.  The sleepers had never been removed, and the rails, fish-plates and rivets were all ready, for we had taken them from a  siding on the abandoned portion of the line.  With my small but  competent band of workers, we had everything ready long before the  special arrived.  When it did arrive, it ran off upon the small  side line so easily that the jolting of the points appears to have  been entirely unnoticed by the two travellers. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Our plan had been that Smith, the stoker, should chloroform  John Slater, the driver, so that he should vanish with the others.   In this respect, and in this respect only, our plans miscarried - I  except the criminal folly of McPherson in writing home to his wife.   Our stoker did his business so clumsily that Slater in his  struggles fell off the engine, and though fortune was with us so  far that he broke his neck in the fall, still he remained as a blot  upon that which would otherwise have been one of those complete  masterpieces which are only to be contemplated in silent  admiration.  The criminal expert will find in John Slater the one  flaw in all our admirable combinations.  A man who has had as many  triumphs as I can afford to be frank, and I therefore lay my finger  upon John Slater, and I proclaim him to be a flaw. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "But now I have got our special train upon the small line two  kilometres, or rather more than one mile, in length, which leads,  or rather used to lead, to the abandoned Heartsease mine, once one  of the largest coal mines in England.  You will ask how it is that  no one saw the train upon this unused line.  I answer that along  its entire length it runs through a deep cutting, and that, unless  someone had been on the edge of that cutting, he could not have  seen it.  There WAS someone on the edge of that cutting.  I was  there.  And now I will tell you what I saw. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "My assistant had remained at the points in order that he might  superintend the switching off of the train.  He had four armed men  with him, so that if the train ran off the line - we thought it  probable, because the points were very rusty - we might still have  resources to fall back upon.  Having once seen it safely on the  side line, he handed over the responsibility to me.  I was waiting  at a point which overlooks the mouth of the mine, and I was also  armed, as were my two companions.  Come what might, you see, I was  always ready. </p></div>

			<div class="pagers" id="16"><a href="LosSpe.shtml.html#15"><b>&lt;</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="LosSpe.shtml.html#16">16</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="LosSpe.shtml.html#17"><b>&gt;</b></a></div>
			
			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The moment that the train was fairly on the side line, Smith,  the stoker, slowed-down the engine, and then, having turned it on  to the fullest speed again, he and McPherson, with my English  lieutenant, sprang off before it was too late.  It may be that it  was this slowing-down which first attracted the attention of the  travellers, but the train was running at full speed again before  their heads appeared at the open window.  It makes me smile to  think how bewildered they must have been.  Picture to yourself your  own feelings if, on looking out of your luxurious carriage, you  suddenly perceived that the lines upon which you ran were rusted  and corroded, red and yellow with disuse and decay!  What a catch  must have come in their breath as in a second it flashed upon them  that it was not Manchester but Death which was waiting for them at  the end of that sinister line.  But the train was running with  frantic speed, rolling and rocking over the rotten line, while  the wheels made a frightful screaming sound upon the rusted  surface.  I was close to them, and could see their faces.  Caratal  was praying, I think - there was something like a rosary dangling  out of his hand.  The other roared like a bull who smells the blood  of the slaughter-house.  He saw us standing on the bank, and he  beckoned to us like a madman.  Then he tore at his wrist and threw  his dispatch-box out of the window in our direction.  Of course,  his meaning was obvious.  Here was the evidence, and they would  promise to be silent if their lives were spared.  It would have  been very agreeable if we could have done so, but business is  business.  Besides, the train was now as much beyond our controls  as theirs. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "He ceased howling when the train rattled round the curve and  they saw the black mouth of the mine yawning before them.  We had  removed the boards which had covered it, and we had cleared the  square entrance.  The rails had formerly run very close to the  shaft for the convenience of loading the coal, and we had only to  add two or three lengths of rail in order to lead to the very brink  of the shaft.  In fact, as the lengths would not quite fit, our  line projected about three feet over the edge.  We saw the two  heads at the window: Caratal below, Gomez above; but they had both  been struck silent by what they saw.  And yet they could not  withdraw their heads.  The sight seemed to have paralysed them. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I had wondered how the train running at a great speed would  take the pit into which I had guided it, and I was much interested  in watching it.  One of my colleagues thought that it would  actually jump it, and indeed it was not very far from doing so.   Fortunately, however, it fell short, and the buffers of the engine  struck the other lip of the shaft with a tremendous crash.  The  funnel flew off into the air.  The tender, carriages, and van were  all smashed up into one jumble, which, with the remains of the  engine, choked for a minute or so the mouth of the pit.  Then  something gave way in the middle, and the whole mass of green iron,  smoking coals, brass fittings, wheels, wood-work, and cushions all  crumbled together and crashed down into the mine.  We heard the  rattle, rattle, rattle, as the debris struck against the walls, and  then, quite a long time afterwards, there came a deep roar as the  remains of the train struck the bottom.  The boiler may have  burst, for a sharp crash came after the roar, and then a dense  cloud of steam and smoke swirled up out of the black depths,  falling in a spray as thick as rain all round us.  Then the vapour  shredded off into thin wisps, which floated away in the summer  sunshine, and all was quiet again in the Heartsease mine. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "And now, having carried out our plans so successfully, it only  remained to leave no trace behind us.  Our little band of workers  at the other end had already ripped up the rails and disconnected  the side line, replacing everything as it had been before.  We were  equally busy at the mine.  The funnel and other fragments were  thrown in, the shaft was planked over as it used to be, and the  lines which led to it were torn up and taken away.  Then, without  flurry, but without delay, we all made our way out of the country,  most of us to Paris, my English colleague to Manchester, and  McPherson to Southampton, whence he emigrated to America.  Let the  English papers of that date tell how throughly we had done our  work, and how completely we had thrown the cleverest of their  detectives off our track. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "You will remember that Gomez threw his bag of papers out of  the window, and I need not say that I secured that bag and brought  them to my employers.  It may interest my employers now, however,  to learn that out of that bag I took one or two little papers as a  souvenir of the occasion.  I have no wish to publish these papers;  but, still, it is every man for himself in this world, and what  else can I do if my friends will not come to my aid when I want  them?  Messieurs, you may believe that Herbert de Lernac is quite  as formidable when he is against you as when he is with you, and  that he is not a man to go to the guillotine until he has seen that  every one of you is en route for New Caledonia.  For your own  sake, if not for mine, make haste, Monsieur de -- , and  General -- , and Baron --(you can fill up the blanks for  yourselves as you read this).  I promise you that in the next  edition there will be no blanks to fill. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "P.S. - As I look over my statement there is only one omission  which I can see.  It concerns the unfortunate man McPherson, who  was foolish enough to write to his wife and to make an appointment  with her in New York.  It can be imagined that when interests like  ours were at stake, we could not leave them to the chance of  whether a man in that class of life would or would not give  away his secrets to a woman.  Having once broken his oath by  writing to his wife, we could not trust him any more.  We took  steps therefore to insure that he should not see his wife.  I have  sometimes thought that it would be a kindness to write to her and  to assure her that there is no impediment to her marrying again."</div>
