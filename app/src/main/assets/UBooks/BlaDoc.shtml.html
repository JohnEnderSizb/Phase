<div class="story_text" id="1"><p>Bishop's Crossing is a small village lying ten miles in a south-westerly direction from Liverpool.  Here in the early seventies  there settled a doctor named Aloysius Lana.  Nothing was known  locally either of his antecedents or of the reasons which had  prompted him to come to this Lancashire hamlet.  Two facts only  were certain about him; the one that he had gained his medical  qualification with some distinction at Glasgow; the other that he  came undoubtedly of a tropical race, and was so dark that he  might almost have had a strain of the Indian in his composition.   His predominant features were, however, European, and he  possessed a stately courtesy and carriage which suggested a  Spanish extraction.  A swarthy skin, raven-black hair, and dark,  sparkling eyes under a pair of heavily-tufted brows made a  strange contrast to the flaxen or chestnut rustics of England,  and the newcomer was soon known as "The Black Doctor of Bishop's  Crossing."  At first it was a term of ridicule and reproach; as  the years went on it became a title of honour which was familiar  to the whole countryside, and extended far beyond the narrow  confines of the village. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        For the newcomer proved himself to be a capable surgeon and an  accomplished physician.  The practice of that district had been in  the hands of Edward Rowe, the son of Sir William Rowe, the  Liverpool consultant, but he had not inherited the talents of his  father, and Dr. Lana, with his advantages of presence and of  manner, soon beat him out of the field.  Dr. Lana's social success  was as rapid as his professional.  A remarkable surgical cure in  the case of the Hon. James Lowry, the second son of Lord Belton,  was the means of introducing him to county society, where he became  a favourite through the charm of his conversation and the elegance  of his manners.  An absence of antecedents and of relatives is  sometimes an aid rather than an impediment to social advancement,  and the distinguished individuality of the handsome doctor was its  own recommendation. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        His patients had one fault - and one fault only - to find with  him.  He appeared to be a confirmed bachelor.  This was the more  remarkable since the house which he occupied was a large one, and  it was known that his success in practice had enabled him to save  considerable sums.  At first the local matchmakers were continually  coupling his name with one or other of the eligible ladies, but as  years passed and Dr. Lana remained unmarried, it came to be  generally understood that for some reason he must remain a  bachelor.  Some even went so far as to assert that he was already  married, and that it was in order to escape the consequence of an  early misalliance that he had buried himself at Bishop's Crossing.   And, then, just as the matchmakers had finally given him up in  despair, his engagement was suddenly announced to Miss Frances  Morton, of Leigh Hall. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Miss Morton was a young lady who was well known upon the  country-side, her father, James Haldane Morton, having been the  Squire of Bishop's Crossing.  Both her parents were, however, dead,  and she lived with her only brother, Arthur Morton, who had  inherited the family estate.  In person Miss Morton was tall and  stately, and she was famous for her quick, impetuous nature and for  her strength of character.  She met Dr. Lana at a garden-party, and  a friendship, which quickly ripened into love, sprang up between  them.  Nothing could exceed their devotion to each other.  There  was some discrepancy in age, he being thirty-seven, and she twenty-four; but, save in that one respect, there was no possible  objection to be found with the match.  The engagement was in  February, and it was arranged that the marriage should take place  in August. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Upon the 3rd of June Dr. Lana received a letter from abroad.   In a small village the postmaster is also in a position to be the  gossip-master, and Mr. Bankley, of Bishop's Crossing, had many of  the secrets of his neighbours in his possession.  Of this  particular letter he remarked only that it was in a curious  envelope, that it was in a man's handwriting, that the postscript  was Buenos Ayres, and the stamp of the Argentine Republic.  It was  the first letter which he had ever known Dr. Lana to have from  abroad and this was the reason why his attention was particularly  called to it before he handed it to the local postman.  It was  delivered by the evening delivery of that date. </p></div>

			<div class="pagers" id="3"><a href="BlaDoc.shtml.html#2"><b>&lt;</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="BlaDoc.shtml.html#3">3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="BlaDoc.shtml.html#4"><b>&gt;</b></a></div>
			
			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Next morning - that is, upon the 4th of June - Dr. Lana called  upon Miss Morton, and a long interview followed, from which he was  observed to return in a state of great agitation.  Miss Morton  remained in her room all that day, and her maid found her several  times in tears.  In the course of a week it was an open secret to  the whole village that the engagement was at an end, that Dr. Lana  had behaved shamefully to the young lady, and that Arthur Morton,  her brother, was talking of horse-whipping him.  In what particular  respect the doctor had behaved badly was unknown - some surmised one  thing and some another; but it was observed, and taken as the  obvious sign of a guilty conscience, that he would go for miles  round rather than pass the windows of Leigh Hall, and that he gave  up attending morning service upon Sundays where he might have met  the young lady.  There was an advertisement also in the Lancet  as to the sale of a practice which mentioned no names, but which  was thought by some to refer to Bishop's Crossing, and to mean that  Dr. Lana was thinking of abandoning the scene of his success.  Such  was the position of affairs when, upon the evening of Monday, June  21st, there came a fresh development which changed what had been a  mere village scandal into a tragedy which arrested the attention of  the whole nation.  Some detail is necessary to cause the facts of  that evening to present their full significance. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The sole occupants of the doctor's house were his housekeeper,  an elderly and most respectable woman, named Martha Woods, and a  young servant - Mary Pilling.  The coachman and the surgery-boy  slept out.  It was the custom of the doctor to sit at night in his  study, which was next the surgery in the wing of the house which  was farthest from the servants' quarters.  This side of the house  had a door of its own for the convenience of patients, so that it  was possible for the doctor to admit and receive a visitor there  without the knowledge of anyone.  As a matter of fact, when  patients came late it was quite usual for him to let them in and  out by the surgery entrance, for the maid and the housekeeper were  in the habit of retiring early. </p></div>

			<div class="pagers" id="4"><a href="BlaDoc.shtml.html#3"><b>&lt;</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="BlaDoc.shtml.html#4">4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="BlaDoc.shtml.html#5"><b>&gt;</b></a></div>
			
			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        On this particular night Martha Woods went into the doctor's  study at half-past nine, and found him writing at his desk.  She   bade him good night, sent the maid to bed, and then occupied  herself until a quarter to eleven in household matters.  It was  striking eleven upon the hall clock when she went to her own room.   She had been there about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes  when she heard a cry or call, which appeared to come from within  the house.  She waited some time, but it was not repeated.  Much  alarmed, for the sound was loud and urgent, she put on a dressing-gown, and ran at the top of her speed to the doctor's study. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Who's there?" cried a voice, as she tapped at the door. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I am here, sir - Mrs. Woods." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I beg that you will leave me in peace.  Go back to your room  this instant!" cried the voice, which was, to the best of her  belief, that of her master.  The tone was so harsh and so unlike  her master's usual manner, that she was surprised and hurt. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I thought I heard you calling, sir," she explained, but no  answer was given to her.  Mrs. Woods looked at the clock as she  returned to her room, and it was then half-past eleven. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        At some period between eleven and twelve (she could not be  positive as to the exact hour) a patient called upon the doctor and  was unable to get any reply from him.  This late visitor was Mrs.  Madding, the wife of the village grocer, who was dangerously ill of  typhoid fever.  Dr. Lana had asked her to look in the last thing  and let him know how her husband was progressing.  She observed  that the light was burning in the study, but having knocked several  times at the surgery door without response, she concluded that the  doctor had been called out, and so returned home. </p></div>

			<div class="pagers" id="5"><a href="BlaDoc.shtml.html#4"><b>&lt;</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="BlaDoc.shtml.html#5">5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="BlaDoc.shtml.html#6"><b>&gt;</b></a></div>
			
			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        There is a short, winding drive with a lamp at the end of it  leading down from the house to the road.  As Mrs. Madding emerged  from the gate a man was coming along the footpath.  Thinking that  it might be Dr. Lana returning from some professional visit, she  waited for him, and was surprised to see that it was Mr. Arthur  Morton, the young squire.  In the light of the lamp she observed  that his manner was excited, and that he carried in his hand a  heavy hunting-crop.  He was turning in at the gate when she  addressed him. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The doctor is not in, sir," said she. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "How do you know that?" he asked harshly. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I have been to the surgery door, sir." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I see a light," said the young squire, looking up the drive.   "That is in his study, is it not?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Yes, sir; but I am sure that he is out." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Well, he must come in again," said young Morton, and passed  through the gate while Mrs. Madding went upon her homeward way. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        At three o'clock that morning her husband suffered a sharp  relapse, and she was so alarmed by his symptoms that she determined  to call the doctor without delay.  As she passed through the gate  she was surprised to see someone lurking among the laurel bushes.   It was certainly a man, and to the best of her belief Mr. Arthur  Morton.  Preoccupied with her own troubles, she gave no particular  attention to the incident, but hurried on upon her errand. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        When she reached the house she perceived to her surprise that  the light was still burning in the study.  She therefore tapped at  the surgery door.  There was no answer.  She repeated the knocking  several times without effect.  It appeared to her to be unlikely  that the doctor would either go to bed or go out leaving so  brilliant a light behind him, and it struck Mrs. Madding that it  was possible that he might have dropped asleep in his chair.  She  tapped at the study window, therefore, but without result.  Then,  finding that there was an opening between the curtain and the  woodwork, she looked through. </p></div>

			<div class="pagers" id="6"><a href="BlaDoc.shtml.html#5"><b>&lt;</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="BlaDoc.shtml.html#6">6</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="BlaDoc.shtml.html#7"><b>&gt;</b></a></div>
			
			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The small room was brilliantly lighted from a large lamp on the  central table, which was littered with the doctor's books and  instruments.  No one was visible, nor did she see anything unusual,  except that in the farther shadow thrown by the table a dingy white  glove was lying upon the carpet.  And then suddenly, as her eyes  became more accustomed to the light, a boot emerged from the other  end of the shadow, and she realized, with a thrill of horror, that  what she had taken to be a glove was the hand of a man, who was  prostrate upon the floor.  Understanding that something terrible  had occurred, she rang at the front door, roused Mrs. Woods, the  housekeeper, and the two women made their way into the study,  having first dispatched the maidservant to the police-station. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        At the side of the table, away from the window, Dr. Lana was  discovered stretched upon his back and quite dead.  It was  evident that he had been subjected to violence, for one of his eyes  was blackened and there were marks of bruises about his face and  neck.  A slight thickening and swelling of his features appeared to  suggest that the cause of his death had been strangulation.  He was  dressed in his usual professional clothes, but wore cloth slippers,  the soles of which were perfectly clean.  The carpet was marked all  over, especially on the side of the door, with traces of dirty  boots, which were presumably left by the murderer.  It was evident  that someone had entered by the surgery door, had killed the  doctor, and had then made his escape unseen.  That the assailant  was a man was certain, from the size of the footprints and from the  nature of the injuries.  But beyond that point the police found it  very difficult to go. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        There were no signs of robbery, and the doctor's gold watch was  safe in his pocket.  He kept a heavy cash-box in the room, and this  was discovered to be locked but empty.  Mrs. Woods had an  impression that a large sum was usually kept there, but the doctor  had paid a heavy corn bill in cash only that very day, and it was  conjectured that it was to this and not to a robber that the  emptiness of the box was due.  One thing in the room was missing - but that one thing was suggestive.  The portrait of Miss Morton,  which had always stood upon the side-table, had been taken from its  frame, and carried off.  Mrs. Woods had observed it there when she  waited upon her employer that evening, and now it was gone.  On the  other hand, there was picked up from the floor a green eye-patch,  which the housekeeper could not remember to have seen before.  Such  a patch might, however, be in the possession of a doctor, and there  was nothing to indicate that it was in any way connected with the  crime. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Suspicion could only turn in one direction, and Arthur Morton,  the young squire, was immediately arrested.  The evidence against  him was circumstantial, but damning.  He was devoted to his sister,  and it was shown that since the rupture between her and Dr. Lana he  had been heard again and again to express himself in the most  vindictive terms towards her former lover.  He had, as stated, been  seen somewhere about eleven o'clock entering the doctor's drive  with a hunting-crop in his hand.  He had then, according to the  theory of the police, broken in upon the doctor, whose  exclamation of fear or of anger had been loud enough to attract the  attention of Mrs. Woods.  When Mrs. Woods descended, Dr. Lana had  made up his mind to talk it over with his visitor, and had,  therefore, sent his housekeeper back to her room.  This  conversation had lasted a long time, had become more and more  fiery, and had ended by a personal struggle, in which the doctor  lost his life.  The fact, revealed by a post-mortem, that his  heart was much diseased - an ailment quite unsuspected during his  life - would make it possible that death might in his case ensue  from injuries which would not be fatal to a healthy man.  Arthur  Morton had then removed his sister's photograph, and had made his  way homeward, stepping aside into the laurel bushes to avoid Mrs.  Madding at the gate.  This was the theory of the prosecution, and  the case which they presented was a formidable one. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        On the other hand, there were some strong points for the  defence.  Morton was high-spirited and impetuous, like his sister,  but he was respected and liked by everyone, and his frank and  honest nature seemed to be incapable of such a crime.  His own  explanation was that he was anxious to have a conversation with Dr.  Lana about some urgent family matters (from first to last he  refused even to mention the name of his sister).  He did not  attempt to deny that this conversation would probably have been of  an unpleasant nature.  He had heard from a patient that the doctor  was out, and he therefore waited until about three in the morning  for his return, but as he had seen nothing of him up to that hour,  he had given it up and had returned home.  As to his death, he knew  no more about it than the constable who arrested him.  He had  formerly been an intimate friend of the deceased man; but  circumstances, which he would prefer not to mention, had brought  about a change in his sentiments. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        There were several facts which supported his innocence.  It was  certain that Dr. Lana was alive and in his study at half-past  eleven o'clock.  Mrs. Woods was prepared to swear that it was at  that hour that she had heard his voice.  The friends of the  prisoner contended that it was probable that at that time Dr. Lana  was not alone.  The sound which had originally attracted the  attention of the housekeeper, and her master's unusual impatience  that she should leave him in peace, seemed to point to that.  If  this were so then it appeared to be probable that he had met  his end between the moment when the housekeeper heard his voice and  the time when Mrs. Madding made her first call and found it  impossible to attract his attention.  But if this were the time of  his death, then it was certain that Mr. Arthur Morton could not be  guilty, as it was <i>after</i> this that she had met the young squire  at the gate. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        If this hypothesis were correct, and someone was with Dr. Lana  before Mrs. Madding met Mr. Arthur Morton, then who was this  someone, and what motives had he for wishing evil to the doctor?   It was universally admitted that if the friends of the accused  could throw light upon this, they would have gone a long way  towards establishing his innocence.  But in the meanwhile it was  open to the public to say - as they did say - that there was no proof  that anyone had been there at all except the young squire; while,  on the other hand, there was ample proof that his motives in going  were of a sinister kind.  When Mrs. Madding called, the doctor  might have retired to his room, or he might, as she thought at the  time, have gone out and returned afterwards to find Mr. Arthur  Morton waiting for him.  Some of the supporters of the accused laid  stress upon the fact that the photograph of his sister Frances,  which had been removed from the doctor's room, had not been found  in her brother's possession.  This argument, however, did not count  for much, as he had ample time before his arrest to burn it or to  destroy it.  As to the only positive evidence in the case - the  muddy footmarks upon the floor - they were so blurred by the  softness of the carpet that it was impossible to make any  trustworthy deduction from them.  The most that could be said was  that their appearance was not inconsistent with the theory that  they were made by the accused, and it was further shown that his  boots were very muddy upon that night.  There had been a heavy  shower in the afternoon, and all boots were probably in the same  condition. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Such is a bald statement of the singular and romantic series of  events which centred public attention upon this Lancashire tragedy.   The unknown origin of the doctor, his curious and distinguished  personality, the position of the man who was accused of the murder,  and the love affair which had preceded the crimes all combined to  make the affair one of those dramas which absorb the whole  interest of a nation.  Throughout the three kingdoms men discussed  the case of the Black Doctor of Bishop's Crossing, and many were  the theories put forward to explain the facts; but it may safely be  said that among them all there was not one which prepared the minds  of the public for the extraordinary sequel, which caused so much  excitement upon the first day of the trial, and came to a climax  upon the second.  The long files of the Lancaster Weekly with  their report of the case lie before me as I write, but I must  content myself with a synopsis of the case up to the point when,  upon the evening of the first day, the evidence of Miss Frances  Morton threw a singular light upon the case. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Mr. Porlock Carr, the counsel for the prosecution, had  marshalled his facts with his usual skill, and as the day wore on,  it became more and more evident how difficult was the task which  Mr. Humphrey, who had been retained for the defence, had before  him.  Several witnesses were put up to swear to the intemperate  expressions which the young squire had been heard to utter about  the doctor, and the fiery manner in which he resented the alleged  ill-treatment of his sister.  Mrs. Madding repeated her evidence as  to the visit which had been paid late at night by the prisoner to  the deceased, and it was shown by another witness that the prisoner  was aware that the doctor was in the habit of sitting up alone in  this isolated wing of the house, and that he had chosen this very  late hour to call because he knew that his victim would then be at  his mercy.  A servant at the squire's house was compelled to admit  that he had heard his master return about three that morning, which  corroborated Mrs. Madding's statement that she had seen him among  the laurel bushes near the gate upon the occasion of her second  visit.  The muddy boots and an alleged similarity in the footprints  were duly dwelt upon, and it was felt when the case for the  prosecution had been presented that, however circumstantial it  might be, it was none the less so complete and so convincing, that  the fate of the prisoner was sealed, unless something quite  unexpected should be disclosed by the defence.  It was three  o'clock when the prosecution closed.  At half-past four, when the  court rose, a new and unlooked-for development had occurred.  I  extract the incident, or part of it, from the journal which I have  already mentioned, omitting the preliminary observations of the  counsel. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Considerable sensation was caused in the crowded court when the  first witness called for the defence proved to be Miss Frances  Morton, the sister of the prisoner.  Our readers will remember that  the young lady had been engaged to Dr. Lana, and that it was his  anger over the sudden termination of this engagement which was  thought to have driven her brother to the perpetration of this  crime.  Miss Morton had not, however, been directly implicated in  the case in any way, either at the inquest or at the police-court  proceedings, and her appearance as the leading witness for the  defence came as a surprise upon the public. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Miss Frances Morton, who was a tall and handsome brunette, gave  her evidence in a low but clear voice, though it was evident  throughout that she was suffering from extreme emotion.  She  alluded to her engagement to the doctor, touched briefly upon its  termination, which was due, she said, to personal matters connected  with his family, and surprised the court by asserting that she had  always considered her brother's resentment to be unreasonable and  intemperate.  In answer to a direct question from her counsel, she  replied that she did not feel that she had any grievance whatever  against Dr. Lana, and that in her opinion he had acted in a  perfectly honourable manner.  Her brother, on an insufficient  knowledge of the facts, had taken another view, and she was  compelled to acknowledge that, in spite of her entreaties, he had  uttered threats of personal violence against the doctor, and had,  upon the evening of the tragedy, announced his intention of "having  it out with him."  She had done her best to bring him to a more  reasonable frame of mind, but he was very headstrong where his  emotions or prejudices were concerned. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Up to this point the young lady's evidence had appeared to make  against the prisoner rather than in his favour.  The questions of  her counsel, however, soon put a very different light upon the  matter, and disclosed an unexpected line of defence. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Mr. Humphrey:  Do you believe your brother to be guilty of this  crime? </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The Judge:  I cannot permit that question, Mr. Humphrey.  We  are here to decide upon questions of fact - not of belief. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Mr. Humphrey:  Do you know that your brother is not guilty of  the death of Doctor Lana? </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Miss Morton:  Yes. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Mr. Humphrey:  How do you know it? </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Miss Morton:  Because Dr. Lana is not dead. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        There followed a prolonged sensation in court, which  interrupted the examination of the witness. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Mr. Humphrey:  And how do you know, Miss Morton, that Dr. Lana  is not dead? </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Miss Morton:  Because I have received a letter from him since  the date of his supposed death. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Mr. Humphrey:  Have you this letter? </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Miss Morton:  Yes, but I should prefer not to show it. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Mr. Humphrey:  Have you the envelope? </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Miss Morton:  Yes, it is here. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Mr. Humphrey:  What is the post-mark? </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Miss Morton:  Liverpool. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Mr. Humphrey:  And the date? </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Miss Morton:  June the 22nd. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Mr. Humphrey:  That being the day after his alleged death.  Are  you prepared to swear to this handwriting, Miss Morton? </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Miss Morton:  Certainly. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Mr. Humphrey:  I am prepared to call six other witnesses, my  lord, to testify that this letter is in the writing of Doctor Lana. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The Judge:  Then you must call them tomorrow. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Mr. Porlock Carr (counsel for the prosecution): In the  meantime, my lord, we claim possession of this document, so that we  may obtain expert evidence as to how far it is an imitation of the  handwriting of the gentleman whom we still confidently assert to be  deceased.  I need not point out that the theory so unexpectedly  sprung upon us may prove to be a very obvious device adopted by the  friends of the prisoner in order to divert this inquiry.  I would  draw attention to the fact that the young lady must, according to  her own account, have possessed this letter during the proceedings  at the inquest and at the police-court.  She desires us to believe  that she permitted these to proceed, although she held in her  pocket evidence which would at any moment have brought them to an  end. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Mr. Humphrey.  Can you explain this, Miss Morton? </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Miss Morton:  Dr. Lana desired his secret to be preserved. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Mr. Porlock Carr:  Then why have you made this public? </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Miss Morton:  To save my brother. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        A murmur of sympathy broke out in court, which was instantly  suppressed by the Judge. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The Judge:  Admitting this line of defence, it lies with you,  Mr. Humphrey, to throw a light upon who this man is whose body has  been recognized by so many friends and patients of Dr. Lana as  being that of the doctor himself. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        A Juryman:  Has anyone up to now expressed any doubt about the  matter? </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Mr. Porlock Carr:  Not to my knowledge. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Mr. Humphrey:  We hope to make the matter clear. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The Judge:  Then the court adjourns until tomorrow. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        This new development of the case excited the utmost interest  among the general public.  Press comment was prevented by the fact  that the trial was still undecided, but the question was everywhere  argued as to how far there could be truth in Miss Morton's  declaration, and how far it might be a daring ruse for the purpose  of saving her brother.  The obvious dilemma in which the missing  doctor stood was that if by any extraordinary chance he was not  dead, then he must be held responsible for the death of this  unknown man, who resembled him so exactly, and who was found in his  study.  This letter which Miss Morton refused to produce was  possibly a confession of guilt, and she might find herself in the  terrible position of only being able to save her brother from the  gallows by the sacrifice of her former lover.  The court next  morning was crammed to overflowing, and a murmur of excitement  passed over it when Mr. Humphrey was observed to enter in a state  of emotion, which even his trained nerves could not conceal, and to  confer with the opposing counsel.  A few hurried words - words which  left a look of amazement upon Mr. Porlock Carr's face - passed  between them, and then the counsel for the defence, addressing the  Judge, announced that, with the consent of the prosecution, the  young lady who had given evidence upon the sitting before would not  be recalled. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The Judge: But you appear, Mr. Humphrey, to have left matters  in a very unsatisfactory state.  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Mr. Humphrey:  Perhaps, my lord, my next witness may help to  clear them up. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The Judge:  Then call your next witness. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Mr. Humphrey:  I call Dr. Aloysius Lana. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The learned counsel has made many telling remarks in his day,  but he has certainly never produced such a sensation with so short  a sentence.  The court was simply stunned with amazement as the  very man whose fate had been the subject of so much contention  appeared bodily before them in the witness-box.  Those among the  spectators who had known him at Bishop's Crossing saw him now,  gaunt and thin, with deep lines of care upon his face.  But in  spite of his melancholy bearing and despondent expression, there  were few who could say that they had ever seen a man of more  distinguished presence.  Bowing to the judge, he asked if he might  be allowed to make a statement, and having been duly informed that  whatever he said might be used against him, he bowed once more, and  proceeded: </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "My wish," said he, "is to hold nothing back, but to tell with  perfect frankness all that occurred upon the night of the 21st of  June.  Had I known that the innocent had suffered, and that so much  trouble had been brought upon those whom I love best in the world,  I should have come forward long ago; but there were reasons which  prevented these things from coming to my ears.  It was my desire  that an unhappy man should vanish from the world which had known  him, but I had not foreseen that others would be affected by my  actions.  Let me to the best of my ability repair the evil which I  have done. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "To anyone who is acquainted with the history of the Argentine  Republic the name of Lana is well known.  My father, who came of  the best blood of old Spain, filled all the highest offices of the  State, and would have been President but for his death in the riots  of San Juan.  A brilliant career might have been open to my twin  brother Ernest and myself had it not been for financial losses  which made it necessary that we should earn our own living.  I  apologize, sir, if these details appear to be irrelevant, but they  are a necessary introduction to that which is to follow. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I had, as I have said, a twin brother named Ernest, whose  resemblance to me was so great that even when we were together  people could see no difference between us.  Down to the smallest  detail we were exactly the same.  As we grew older this  likeness became less marked because our expression was not the  same, but with our features in repose the points of difference were  very slight. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "It does not become me to say too much of one who is dead, the  more so as he is my only brother, but I leave his character to  those who knew him best.  I will only say - for I <i>have</i>to say  it - that in my early manhood I conceived a horror of him, and that  I had good reason for the aversion which filled me.  My own  reputation suffered from his actions, for our close resemblance  caused me to be credited with many of them.  Eventually, in a  peculiarly disgraceful business, he contrived to throw the whole  odium upon me in such a way that I was forced to leave the  Argentine for ever, and to seek a career in Europe.  The freedom  from his hated presence more than compensated me for the loss of my  native land.  I had enough money to defray my medical studies at  Glasgow, and I finally settled in practice at Bishop's Crossing, in  the firm conviction that in that remote Lancashire hamlet I should  never hear of him again. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "For years my hopes were fulfilled, and then at last he  discovered me.  Some Liverpool man who visited Buenos Ayres put him  upon my track.  He had lost all his money, and he thought that he  would come over and share mine.  Knowing my horror of him, he  rightly thought that I would be willing to buy him off.  I received  a letter from him saying that he was coming.  It was at a crisis in  my own affairs, and his arrival might conceivably bring trouble,  and even disgrace, upon some whom I was especially bound to shield  from anything of the kind.  I took steps to insure that any evil  which might come should fall on me only, and that" - here he turned  and looked at the prisoner - "was the cause of conduct upon my part  which has been too harshly judged.  My only motive was to screen  those who were dear to me from any possible connection with scandal  or disgrace.  That scandal and disgrace would come with my brother  was only to say that what had been would be again. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "My brother arrived himself one night not very long after my  receipt of the letter.  I was sitting in my study after the  servants had gone to bed, when I heard a footstep upon the gravel  outside, and an instant later I saw his face looking in at me  through the window.  He was a clean-shaven man like myself,  and the resemblance between us was still so great that, for an  instant, I thought it was my own reflection in the glass.  He had  a dark patch over his eye, but our features were absolutely the  same.  Then he smiled in a sardonic way which had been a trick of  his from his boyhood, and I knew that he was the same brother who  had driven me from my native land, and brought disgrace upon what  had been an honourable name.  I went to the door and I admitted  him.  That would be about ten o'clock that night. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "When he came into the glare of the lamp, I saw at once that he  had fallen upon very evil days.  He had walked from Liverpool, and  he was tired and ill.  I was quite shocked by the expression upon  his face.  My medical knowledge told me that there was some serious  internal malady.  He had been drinking also, and his face was  bruised as the result of a scuffle which he had had with some  sailors.  It was to cover his injured eye that he wore this patch,  which he removed when he entered the room.  He was himself dressed  in a pea-jacket and flannel shirt, and his feet were bursting  through his boots.  But his poverty had only made him more savagely  vindictive towards me.  His hatred rose to the height of a mania.   I had been rolling in money in England, according to his account,  while he had been starving in South America.  I cannot describe to  you the threats which he uttered or the insults which he poured  upon me.  My impression is, that hardships and debauchery had  unhinged his reason.  He paced about the room like a wild beast,  demanding drink, demanding money, and all in the foulest language.   I am a hot-tempered man, but I thank God that I am able to say that  I remained master of myself, and that I never raised a hand against  him.  My coolness only irritated him the more.  He raved, he  cursed, he shook his fists in my face, and then suddenly a horrible  spasm passed over his features, he clapped his hand to his side,  and with a loud cry he fell in a heap at my feet.  I raised him up  and stretched him upon the sofa, but no answer came to my  exclamations, and the hand which I held in mine was cold and  clammy.  His diseased heart had broken down.  His own violence had  killed him. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "For a long time I sat as if I were in some dreadful dream,  staring at the body of my brother.  I was aroused by the knocking  of Mrs. Woods, who had been disturbed by that dying cry.  I sent  her away to bed.  Shortly afterwards a patient tapped at the  surgery door, but as I took no notice, he or she went off again.   Slowly and gradually as I sat there a plan was forming itself in my  head in the curious automatic way in which plans do form.  When I  rose from my chair my future movements were finally decided upon  without my having been conscious of any process of thought.  It was  an instinct which irresistibly inclined me towards one course. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Ever since that change in my affairs to which I have alluded,  Bishop's Crossing had become hateful to me.  My plans of life had  been ruined, and I had met with hasty judgments and unkind  treatment where I had expected sympathy.  It is true that any  danger of scandal from my brother had passed away with his life;  but still, I was sore about the past, and felt that things could  never be as they had been.  It may be that I was unduly sensitive,  and that I had not made sufficient allowance for others, but my  feelings were as I describe.  Any chance of getting away from  Bishop's Crossing and of everyone in it would be most welcome to  me.  And here was such a chance as I could never have dared to hope  for, a chance which would enable me to make a clean break with the  past. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "There was this dead man lying upon the sofa, so like me that  save for some little thickness and coarseness of the features there  was no difference at all.  No one had seen him come and no one  would miss him.  We were both clean-shaven, and his hair was about  the same length as my own.  If I changed clothes with him, then Dr.  Aloysius Lana would be found lying dead in his study, and there  would be an end of an unfortunate fellow, and of a blighted career.   There was plenty of ready money in the room, and this I could carry  away with me to help me to start once more in some other land.  In  my brother's clothes I could walk by night unobserved as far as  Liverpool, and in that great seaport I would soon find some means  of leaving the country.  After my lost hopes, the humblest  existence where I was unknown was far preferable, in my estimation,  to a practice, however successful, in Bishop's Crossing, where at  any moment I might come face to face with those whom I should wish,  if it were possible, to forget.  I determined to effect the change. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "And I did so.  I will not go into particulars, for the  recollection is as painful as the experience; but in an hour  my brother lay, dressed down to the smallest detail in my clothes,  while I slunk out by the surgery door, and taking the back path  which led across some fields, I started off to make the best of my  way to Liverpool, where I arrived the same night.  My bag of money  and a certain portrait were all I carried out of the house, and I  left behind me in my hurry the shade which my brother had been  wearing over his eye.  Everything else of his I took with me. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I give you my word, sir, that never for one instant did the  idea occur to me that people might think that I had been murdered,  nor did I imagine that anyone might be caused serious danger  through this stratagem by which I endeavoured to gain a fresh start  in the world.  On the contrary, it was the thought of relieving  others from the burden of my presence which was always uppermost in  my mind.  A sailing vessel was leaving Liverpool that very day for  Corunna, and in this I took my passage, thinking that the voyage  would give me time to recover my balance, and to consider the  future.  But before I left my resolution softened.  I bethought me  that there was one person in the world to whom I would not cause an  hour of sadness.  She would mourn me in her heart, however harsh  and unsympathetic her relatives might be.  She understood and  appreciated the motives upon which I had acted, and if the rest of  her family condemned me, she, at least, would not forget.  And so  I sent her a note under the seal of secrecy to save her from a  baseless grief.  If under the pressure of events she broke that  seal, she has my entire sympathy and forgiveness. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "It was only last night that I returned to England, and during  all this time I have heard nothing of the sensation which my  supposed death had caused, nor of the accusation that Mr. Arthur  Morton had been concerned in it.  It was in a late evening paper  that I read an account of the proceedings of yesterday, and I have  come this morning as fast as an express train could bring me to  testify to the truth." </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Such was the remarkable statement of Dr. Aloysius Lana which  brought the trial to a sudden termination.  A subsequent  investigation corroborated it to the extent of finding out the  vessel in which his brother Ernest Lana had come over from South  America.  The ship's doctor was able to testify that he had  complained of a weak heart during the voyage, and that his symptoms  were consistent with such a death as was described. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        As to Dr. Aloysius Lana, he returned to the village from which  he had made so dramatic a disappearance, and a complete  reconciliation was effected between him and the young squire, the  latter having acknowledged that he had entirely misunderstood the  other's motives in withdrawing from his engagement.  That another  reconciliation followed may be judged from a notice extracted from  a prominent column in the Morning Post: </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "A marriage was solemnized upon September 19th, by the Rev.   Stephen Johnson, at the parish church of Bishop's Crossing, between  Aloysius Xavier Lana, son of Don Alfredo Lana, formerly Foreign  Minister of the Argentine Republic, and Frances Morton, only  daughter of the late James Morton, J.P., of Leigh Hall, Bishop's  Crossing, Lancashire."</div>
