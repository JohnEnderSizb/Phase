<div class="story_text" id="1"><p>A shaggy Airedale scented his way along the highroad. He had     not been there before, but he was guided by the trail of his     brethren who had preceded him. He had gone unwillingly upon     this journey, yet with the perfect training of dogs he had     accepted it without complaint. The path had been lonely, and     his heart would have failed him, traveling as he must without     his people, had not these traces of countless dogs before him     promised companionship of a sort at the end of the road.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The landscape had appeared arid at first, for the     translation from recent agony into freedom from pain had been     so numbing in its swiftness that it was some time before he     could fully appreciate the pleasant dog-country through which     he was passing. There were woods with leaves upon the ground     through which to scurry, long grassy slopes for extended runs,     and lakes into which he might plunge for sticks and bring them     back to&mdash;But he did not complete his thought, for the boy     was not with him. A little wave of homesickness possessed     him.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        It made his mind easier to see far ahead a great gate as     high as the heavens, wide enough for all. He understood that     only man built such barriers and by straining his eyes he     fancied he could discern humans passing through to whatever lay     beyond. He broke into a run that he might the more quickly gain     this inclosure made beautiful by men and women; but his     thoughts outran his pace, and he remembered that he had left     the family behind, and again this lovely new compound became     not perfect, since it would lack the family.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The scent of the dogs grew very strong now, and coming     nearer, he discovered, to his astonishment that of the myriads     of those who had arrived ahead of him thousands were still     gathered on the outside of the portal. They sat in a wide     circle spreading out on each side of the entrance, big, little,     curly, handsome, mongrel, thoroughbred dogs of every age,     complexion, and personality. All were apparently waiting for     something, someone, and at the pad of the Airedale's feet on     the hard road they arose and looked in his direction.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        That the interest passed as soon as they discovered the     new-comer to be a dog puzzled him. In his former dwelling-place     a four-footed brother was greeted with enthusiasm when he was a     friend, with suspicious diplomacy when a stranger, and with     sharp reproof when an enemy; but never had he been utterly     ignored.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He remembered something that he had read many times on great     buildings with lofty entrances. "Dogs not admitted," the signs     had said, and he feared this might be the reason for the     waiting circle outside the gate. It might be that this noble     portal stood as the dividing-line between mere dogs and humans.     But he had been a member of the family, romping with them in     the living-room, sitting at meals with them in the dining-room,     going upstairs at night with them, and the thought that he was     to be "kept out" would be unendurable.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He despised the passive dogs. They should be treating a     barrier after the fashion of their old country, leaping against     it, barking, and scratching the nicely painted door. He bounded     up the last little hill to set them an example, for he was     still full of the rebellion of the world; but he found no door     to leap against. He could see beyond the entrance dear masses     of people, yet no dog crossed the threshold. They continued in     their patient ring, their gaze upon the winding road.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He now advanced cautiously to examine the gate. It occurred     to him that it must be fly-time in this region, and he did not     wish to make himself ridiculous before all these strangers by     trying to bolt through an invisible mesh like the one that had     baffled him when he was a little chap. Yet there were no     screens, and despair entered his soul. What bitter punishment     these poor beasts must have suffered before they learned to     stay on this side the arch that led to human beings! What had     they done on earth to merit this? Stolen bones troubled his     conscience, runaway days, sleeping in the best chair until the     key clicked in the lock. These were sins.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        At that moment an English bull-terrier, white, with     liver-colored spots and a jaunty manner, approached him,     snuffling in a friendly way. No sooner had the bull-terrier     smelt his collar than he fell to expressing his joy at meeting     him. The Airedale's reserve was quite thawed by this welcome,     though he did not know just what to make of it.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I know you! I know you!" exclaimed the bull-terrier, adding     inconsequently, "What's your name?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Tam o'Shanter. They call me Tammy," was the answer, with a     pardonable break in the voice.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I know them," said the bull-terrier. "Nice folks."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Best ever," said the Airedale, trying to be nonchalant, and     scratching a flea which was not there. "I don't remember you.     When did you know them?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "About fourteen tags ago, when they were first married. We     keep track of time here by the license-tags. I had four."</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "This is my first and only one. You were before my time, I     guess." He felt young and shy.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Come for a walk, and tell me all about them," was his new     friend's invitation.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Aren't we allowed in there?" asked Tam, looking toward the     gate.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Sure. You can go in whenever you want to. Some of us do at     first, but we don't stay."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Like it better outside?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "No, no; it isn't that."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Then why are all you fellows hanging around here? Any old     dog can see it's better beyond the arch."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "You see, we're waiting for our folks to come."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The Airedale grasped it at once, and nodded     understandingly.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I felt that way when I came along the road. It wouldn't be     what it's supposed to be without them. It wouldn't be the     perfect place."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Not to us," said the bull-terrier.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Fine! I've stolen bones, but it must be that I have been     forgiven, if I'm to see them here again. It's the great good     place all right. But look here," he added as a new thought     struck him, "do they wait for us?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The older inhabitant coughed in slight embarrassment.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The humans couldn't do that very well. It wouldn't be the     thing to have them hang around outside for just a dog&mdash;not     dignified."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Quite right," agreed Tam. "I'm glad they go straight to     their mansions. I'd&mdash;I'd hate to have them missing me as I     am missing them." He sighed. "But, then, they wouldn't have to     wait so long."</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Oh, well, they're getting on. Don't be discouraged,"     comforted the terrier. "And in the meantime it's like a big     hotel in summer&mdash;watching the new arrivals. See, there is     something doing now."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        All the dogs were aroused to excitement by a little figure     making its way uncertainly up the last slope. Half of them     started to meet it, crowding about in a loving, eager pack.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Look out; don't scare it," cautioned the older animals,     while word was passed to those farthest from the gate: "Quick!     Quick! A baby's come!"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Before they had entirely assembled, however, a gaunt yellow     hound pushed through the crowd, gave one sniff at the small     child, and with a yelp of joy crouched at its feet. The baby     embraced the hound in recognition, and the two moved toward the     gate. Just outside the hound stopped to speak to an     aristocratic St. Bernard who had been friendly:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Sorry to leave you, old fellow," he said, "but I'm going in     to watch over the kid. You see, I'm all she has up here."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The bull-terrier looked at the Airedale for     appreciation.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "That's the way we do it," he said proudly.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Yes, but&mdash;" the Airedale put his head on one side in     perplexity.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Yes, but what?" asked the guide.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The dogs that don't have any people&mdash;the nobodies'     dogs?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "That's the best of all. Oh, everything is thought out here.     Crouch down,&mdash;you must be tired,&mdash;and watch," said     the bull-terrier.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Soon they spied another small form making the turn in the     road. He wore a Boy Scout's uniform, but he was a little     fearful, for all that, so new was this adventure. The dogs rose     again and snuffled, but the better groomed of the circle held     back, and in their place a pack of odds and ends of the company     ran down to meet him. The Boy Scout was reassured by their     friendly attitude, and after petting them impartially, he chose     an old-fashioned black and tan, and the two passed in.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Tam looked questioningly.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "They didn't know each other!" he exclaimed.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "But they've always wanted to. That's one of the boys who     used to beg for a dog, but his father wouldn't let him have     one. So all our strays wait for just such little fellows to     come along. Every boy gets a dog, and every dog gets a     master."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I expect the boy's father would like to know that now,"     commented the Airedale. "No doubt he thinks quite often, 'I     wish I'd let him have a dog.'"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The bull-terrier laughed.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "You're pretty near the earth yet, aren't you?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Tam admitted it.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I've a lot of sympathy with fathers and with boys, having     them both in the family, and a mother as well."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The bull-terrier leaped up in astonishment.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "You don't mean to say they keep a boy?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Sure; greatest boy on earth. Ten this year."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Well, well, this is news! I wish they'd kept a boy when I     was there."</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The Airedale looked at his new friend intently.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "See here, who are you?" he demanded.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        But the other hurried on:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I used to run away from them just to play with a boy.     They'd punish me, and I always wanted to tell them it was their     fault for not getting one."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Who are you, anyway?" repeated Tam. "Talking all this     interest in me, too. Whose dog <i>were</i> you?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "You've already guessed. I see it in your quivering snout.     I'm the old dog that had to leave them about ten years     ago."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Their old dog Bully?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Yes, I'm Bully." They nosed each other with deeper     affection, then strolled about the glades shoulder to shoulder.     Bully the more eagerly pressed for news. "Tell me, how are they     getting along?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Very well indeed; they've paid for the house."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I&mdash;I suppose you occupy the kennel?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "No. They said they couldn't stand it to see another dog in     your old place."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Bully stopped to howl gently.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "That touches me. It's generous in you to tell it. To think     they missed me!"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        For a little while they went on in silence, but as evening     fell, and the light from the golden streets inside of the city     gave the only glow to the scene, Bully grew nervous and     suggested that they go back.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "We can't see so well at night, and I like to be pretty     close to the path, especially toward morning."</p></div>

You might not know them just at     first."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Oh, we know them. Sometimes the babies have so grown up     they're rather hazy in their recollection of how we look. They     think we're bigger than we are; but you can't fool us     dogs."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "It's understood," Tam cunningly arranged, "that when he or     she arrives you'll sort of make them feel at home while I wait     for the boy?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "That's the best plan," assented Bully, kindly. "And if by     any chance the little fellow should come first,&mdash;there's     been a lot of them this summer&mdash;of course you'll introduce     me?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I shall be proud to do it."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And so with muzzles sunk between their paws, and with their     eyes straining down the pilgrims' road, they wait outside the     gate.</div>
