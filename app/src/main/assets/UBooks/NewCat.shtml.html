<div class="story_text" id="1"><p>"Look here, Burger," said Kennedy, "I do wish that you would  confide in me." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The two famous students of Roman remains sat together in  Kennedy's comfortable room overlooking the Corso.  The night  was cold, and they had both pulled up their chairs to the  unsatisfactory Italian stove which threw out a zone of stuffiness  rather than of warmth.  Outside under the bright winter stars lay  the modern Rome, the long, double chain of the electric lamps, the  brilliantly lighted cafes, the rushing carriages, and the dense  throng upon the footpaths.  But inside, in the sumptuous chamber of  the rich young English archaelogist, there was only old Rome to be  seen.  Cracked and timeworn friezes hung upon the walls, grey old  busts of senators and soldiers with their fighting heads and their  hard, cruel faces peered out from the corners.  On the centre  table, amidst a litter of inscriptions, fragments, and ornaments,  there stood the famous reconstruction by Kennedy of the Baths of  Caracalla, which excited such interest and admiration when it was  exhibited in Berlin.  Amphorae hung from the ceiling, and a litter  of curiosities strewed the rich red Turkey carpet.  And of them all  there was not one which was not of the most unimpeachable  authenticity, and of the utmost rarity and value; for Kennedy,  though little more than thirty, had a European reputation in this  particular branch of research, and was, moreover, provided with  that long purse which either proves to be a fatal handicap to the  student's energies, or, if his mind is still true to its purpose,  gives him an enormous advantage in the race for fame.  Kennedy had  often been seduced by whim and pleasure from his studies, but his  mind was an incisive one, capable of long and concentrated efforts  which ended in sharp reactions of sensuous languor.  His handsome  face, with its high, white forehead, its aggressive nose, and its  somewhat loose and sensual mouth, was a fair index of the  compromise between strength and weakness in his nature. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Of a very different type was his companion, Julius Burger.  He  came of a curious blend, a German father and an Italian mother,  with the robust qualities of the North mingling strangely with the  softer graces of the South.  Blue Teutonic eyes lightened his sun-browned face, and above them rose a square, massive forehead, with  a fringe of close yellow curls lying round it.  His strong, firm  jaw was clean-shaven, and his companion had frequently remarked how  much it suggested those old Roman busts which peered out from the  shadows in the corners of his chamber.  Under its bluff German  strength there lay always a suggestion of Italian subtlety, but  the smile was so honest, and the eyes so frank, that one understood  that this was only an indication of his ancestry, with no actual  bearing upon his character.  In age and in reputation, he was on  the same level as his English companion, but his life and his work  had both been far more arduous.  Twelve years before, he had come  as a poor student to Rome, and had lived ever since upon some small  endowment for research which had been awarded to him by the  University of Bonn.  Painfully, slowly, and doggedly, with  extraordinary tenacity and single-mindedness, he had climbed from  rung to rung of the ladder of fame, until now he was a member of  the Berlin Academy, and there was every reason to believe that he  would shortly be promoted to the Chair of the greatest of German  Universities.  But the singleness of purpose which had brought him  to the same high level as the rich and brilliant Englishman, had  caused him in everything outside their work to stand infinitely  below him.  He had never found a pause in his studies in which to  cultivate the social graces.  It was only when he spoke of his own  subject that his face was filled with life and soul.  At other  times he was silent and embarrassed, too conscious of his own  limitations in larger subjects, and impatient of that small talk  which is the conventional refuge of those who have no thoughts to  express. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And yet for some years there had been an acquaintanceship which  appeared to be slowly ripening into a friendship between these two  very different rivals.  The base and origin of this lay in the fact  that in their own studies each was the only one of the younger men  who had knowledge and enthusiasm enough to properly appreciate the  other.  Their common interests and pursuits had brought them  together, and each had been attracted by the other's knowledge.   And then gradually something had been added to this.  Kennedy had  been amused by the frankness and simplicity of his rival, while  Burger in turn had been fascinated by the brilliancy and vivacity  which had made Kennedy such a favourite in Roman society.  I say  "had," because just at the moment the young Englishman was somewhat  under a cloud.  A love-affair, the details of which had never quite  come out, had indicated a heartlessness and callousness upon his  part which shocked many of his friends.  But in the bachelor  circles of students and artists in which he preferred to move  there is no very rigid code of honour in such matters, and though  a head might be shaken or a pair of shoulders shrugged over the  flight of two and the return of one, the general sentiment was  probably one of curiosity and perhaps of envy rather than of  reprobation. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Look here, Burger," said Kennedy, looking hard at the placid  face of his companion, "I do wish that you would confide in me." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        As he spoke he waved his hand in the direction of a rug which  lay upon the floor.  On the rug stood a long, shallow fruit-basket  of the light wicker-work which is used in the Campagna, and this  was heaped with a litter of objects, inscribed tiles, broken  inscriptions, cracked mosaics, torn papyri, rusty metal ornaments,  which to the uninitiated might have seemed to have come straight  from a dustman's bin, but which a specialist would have speedily  recognized as unique of their kind.  The pile of odds and ends in  the flat wicker-work basket supplied exactly one of those missing  links of social development which are of such interest to the  student.  It was the German who had brought them in, and the  Englishman's eyes were hungry as he looked at them. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I won't interfere with your treasure-trove, but I should very  much like to hear about it," he continued, while Burger very  deliberately lit a cigar.  "It is evidently a discovery of the  first importance.  These inscriptions will make a sensation  throughout Europe." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "For every one here there are a million there!" said the  German.  "There are so many that a dozen savants might spend a  lifetime over them, and build up a reputation as solid as the  Castle of St. Angelo." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Kennedy sat thinking with his fine forehead wrinkled and his  fingers playing with his long, fair moustache. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "You have given yourself away, Burger!" said he at last.  "Your  words can only apply to one thing.  You have discovered a new  catacomb." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I had no doubt that you had already come to that conclusion  from an examination of these objects." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Well, they certainly appeared to indicate it, but your last  remarks make it certain.  There is no place except a catacomb which  could contain so vast a store of relics as you describe." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Quite so.  There is no mystery about that.  I HAVE  discovered a new catacomb." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Where?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Ah, that is my secret, my dear Kennedy.  Suffice it that it is  so situated that there is not one chance in a million of anyone  else coming upon it.  Its date is different from that of any known  catacomb, and it has been reserved for the burial of the highest  Christians, so that the remains and the relics are quite different  from anything which has ever been seen before.  If I was not aware  of your knowledge and of your energy, my friend, I would not  hesitate, under the pledge of secrecy, to tell you everything about  it.  But as it is I think that I must certainly prepare my own  report of the matter before I expose myself to such formidable  competition." </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Kennedy loved his subject with a love which was almost a  mania - a love which held him true to it, amidst all the  distractions which come to a wealthy and dissipated young man.  He  had ambition, but his ambition was secondary to his mere abstract  joy and interest in everything which concerned the old life and  history of the city.  He yearned to see this new underworld which  his companion had discovered. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Look here, Burger," said he, earnestly, "I assure you that you  can trust me most implicitly in the matter.  Nothing would induce  me to put pen to paper about anything which I see until I have your  express permission.  I quite understand your feeling and I think it  is most natural, but you have really nothing whatever to fear from  me.  On the other hand, if you don't tell me I shall make a  systematic search, and I shall most certainly discover it.  In that  case, of course, I should make what use I liked of it, since I  should be under no obligation to you." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Burger smiled thoughtfully over his cigar. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I have noticed, friend Kennedy," said he, "that when I want  information over any point you are not always so ready to supply  it." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "When did you ever ask me anything that I did not tell you?   You remember, for example, my giving you the material for your  paper about the temple of the Vestals." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Ah, well, that was not a matter of much importance.  If I were  to question you upon some intimate thing would you give me an answer, I  wonder!  This new catacomb is a very intimate thing  to me, and I should certainly expect some sign of confidence in  return." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "What you are driving at I cannot imagine," said the  Englishman, "but if you mean that you will answer my question about  the catacomb if I answer any question which you may put to me I can  assure you that I will certainly do so." </p></div>

			<div class="pagers" id="5"><a href="NewCat.shtml.html#4"><b>&lt;</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="NewCat.shtml.html#5">5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="NewCat.shtml.html#6"><b>&gt;</b></a></div>
			
			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Well, then," said Burger, leaning luxuriously back in his  settee, and puffing a blue tree of cigar-smoke into the air, "tell  me all about your relations with Miss Mary Saunderson." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Kennedy sprang up in his chair and glared angrily at his  impassive companion. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "What the devil do you mean?" he cried.  "What sort of a  question is this?  You may mean it as a joke, but you never made a  worse one." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "No, I don't mean it as a joke," said Burger, simply.  "I am  really rather interested in the details of the matter.  I don't  know much about the world and women and social life and that sort  of thing, and such an incident has the fascination of the unknown  for me.  I know you, and I knew her by sight - I had even spoken to  her once or twice.  I should very much like to hear from your own  lips exactly what it was which occurred between you." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I won't tell you a word." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "That's all right.  It was only my whim to see if you would  give up a secret as easily as you expected me to give up my secret  of the new catacomb.  You wouldn't, and I didn't expect you to.   But why should you expect otherwise of me?  There's Saint John's  clock striking ten.  It is quite time that I was going home." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "No; wait a bit, Burger," said Kennedy; "this is really a  ridiculous caprice of yours to wish to know about an old love-affair which has burned out months ago.  You know we look upon a  man who kisses and tells as the greatest coward and villain  possible." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Certainly," said the German, gathering up his basket of  curiosities, "when he tells anything about a girl which is  previously unknown he must be so.  But in this case, as you must be  aware, it was a public matter which was the common talk of Rome, so  that you are not really doing Miss Mary Saunderson any injury  by discussing her case with me.  But still, I respect your  scruples; and so good night!" </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Wait a bit, Burger," said Kennedy, laying his hand upon the  other's arm; "I am very keen upon this catacomb business, and I  can't let it drop quite so easily.  Would you mind asking me  something else in return - something not quite so eccentric this  time?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "No, no; you have refused, and there is an end of it," said  Burger, with his basket on his arm.  "No doubt you are quite right  not to answer, and no doubt I am quite right also - and so again, my  dear Kennedy, good night!" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The Englishman watched Burger cross the room, and he had his  hand on the handle of the door before his host sprang up with the  air of a man who is making the best of that which cannot be helped. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Hold on, old fellow," said he; "I think you are behaving in a  most ridiculous fashion; but still; if this is your condition, I  suppose that I must submit to it.  I hate saying anything about a  girl, but, as you say, it is all over Rome, and I don't suppose I  can tell you anything which you do not know already.  What was it  you wanted to know?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The German came back to the stove, and, laying down his basket,  he sank into his chair once more. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "May I have another cigar?" said he.  "Thank you very much!  I  never smoke when I work, but I enjoy a chat much more when I am  under the influence of tobacco.  Now, as regards this young lady,  with whom you had this little adventure.  What in the world has  become of her?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "She is at home with her own people." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Oh, really - in England?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Yes." </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "What part of England - London?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "No, Twickenham." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "You must excuse my curiosity, my dear Kennedy, and you must  put it down to my ignorance of the world.  No doubt it is quite a  simple thing to persuade a young lady to go off with you for three  weeks or so, and then to hand her over to her own family at - what  did you call the place?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Twickenham." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Quite so - at Twickenham.  But it is something so entirely  outside my own experience that I cannot even imagine how you set  about it.  For example, if you had loved this girl your love could  hardly disappear in three weeks, so I presume that you could not  have loved her at all.  But if you did not love her why should you  make this great scandal which has damaged you and ruined her?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Kennedy looked moodily into the red eye of the stove. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "That's a logical way of looking at it, certainly," said he.   "Love is a big word, and it represents a good many different shades  of feeling.  I liked her, and - well, you say you've seen her  - you  know how charming she could look.  But still I am willing to admit,  looking back, that I could never have really loved her." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Then, my dear Kennedy, why did you do it?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The adventure of the thing had a great deal to do with it." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "What!  You are so fond of adventures!" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Where would the variety of life be without them?  It was for  an adventure that I first began to pay my attentions to her.  I've  chased a good deal of game in my time, but there's no chase like  that of a pretty woman.  There was the piquant difficulty of it  also, for, as she was the companion of Lady Emily Rood, it was  almost impossible to see her alone.  On the top of all the other  obstacles which attracted me, I learned from her own lips very  early in the proceedings that she was engaged." </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Mein Gott!  To whom?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "She mentioned no names." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I do not think that anyone knows that.  So that made the  adventure more alluring, did it?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Well, it did certainly give a spice to it.  Don't you think  so?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I tell you that I am very ignorant about these things." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "My dear fellow, you can remember that the apple you stole from  your neighbour's tree was always sweeter than that which fell from  your own.  And then I found that she cared for me." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "What - at once?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Oh, no, it took about three months of sapping and mining.  But  at last I won her over.  She understood that my judicial separation  from my wife made it impossible for me to do the right thing by  her - but she came all the same, and we had a delightful time, as  long as it lasted." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "But how about the other man?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Kennedy shrugged his shoulders. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I suppose it is the survival of the fittest," said he.  "If he  had been the better man she would not have deserted him.  Let's  drop the subject, for I have had enough of it!" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Only one other thing.  How did you get rid of her in three  weeks?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Well, we had both cooled down a bit, you understand.  She  absolutely refused, under any circumstances, to come back to face  the people she had known in Rome.  Now, of course, Rome is  necessary to me, and I was already pining to be back at my work - so  there was one obvious cause of separation.  Then, again, her old  father turned up at the hotel in London, and there was a scene, and  the whole thing became so unpleasant that really - though I missed  her dreadfully at first - I was very glad to slip out of it.  Now,  I rely upon you not to repeat anything of what I have said." </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "My dear Kennedy, I should not dream of repeating it.  But all  that you say interests me very much, for it gives me an insight  into your way of looking at things, which is entirely different  from mine, for I have seen so little of life.  And now you want to  know about my new catacomb.  There's no use my trying to describe  it, for you would never find it by that.  There is only one thing,  and that is for me to take you there." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "That would be splendid." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "When would you like to come?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The sooner the better.  I am all impatience to see it." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Well, it is a beautiful night - though a trifle cold.  Suppose  we start in an hour.  We must be very careful to keep the matter to  ourselves.  If anyone saw us hunting in couples they would suspect  that there was something going on." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "We can't be too cautious," said Kennedy.  "Is it far?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Some miles." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Not too far to walk?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Oh, no, we could walk there easily." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "We had better do so, then.  A cabman's suspicions would be  aroused if he dropped us both at some lonely spot in the dead  of the night." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Quite so.  I think it would be best for us to meet at the Gate  of the Appian Way at midnight.  I must go back to my lodgings for  the matches and candles and things." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "All right, Burger!  I think it is very kind of you to let me  into this secret, and I promise you that I will write nothing about  it until you have published your report.  Good-bye for the present!   You will find me at the Gate at twelve." </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The cold, clear air was filled with the musical chimes from  that city of clocks as Burger, wrapped in an Italian overcoat, with  a lantern hanging from his hand, walked up to the rendezvous.   Kennedy stepped out of the shadow to meet him. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "You are ardent in work as well as in love!" said the German,  laughing. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Yes; I have been waiting here for nearly half an hour." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I hope you left no clue as to where we were going." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Not such a fool!  By Jove, I am chilled to the bone!  Come on,  Burger, let us warm ourselves by a spurt of hard walking." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Their footsteps sounded loud and crisp upon the rough stone  paving of the disappointing road which is all that is left of the  most famous highway of the world.  A peasant or two going home from  the wine-shop, and a few carts of country produce coming up to  Rome, were the only things which they met.  They swung along, with  the huge tombs looming up through the darkness upon each side of  them, until they had come as far as the Catacombs of St. Calistus,  and saw against a rising moon the great circular bastion of Cecilia  Metella in front of them.  Then Burger stopped with his hand to his  side. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Your legs are longer than mine, and you are more accustomed to  walking," said he, laughing.  "I think that the place where we turn  off is somewhere here.  Yes, this is it, round the corner of the  trattoria.  Now, it is a very narrow path, so perhaps I had better  go in front and you can follow." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He had lit his lantern, and by its light they were enabled to  follow a narrow and devious track which wound across the marshes of  the Campagna.  The great Aqueduct of old Rome lay like a monstrous  caterpillar across the moonlit landscape, and their road led  them under one of its huge arches, and past the circle of crumbling  bricks which marks the old arena.  At last Burger stopped at a  solitary wooden cow-house, and he drew a key from his pocket.  "Surely your catacomb is not inside a house!" cried Kennedy </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The entrance to it is.  That is just the safeguard which we  have against anyone else discovering it." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Does the proprietor know of it?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Not he.  He had found one or two objects which made me almost  certain that his house was built on the entrance to such a place.   So I rented it from him, and did my excavations for myself.  Come  in, and shut the door behind you." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        It was a long, empty building, with the mangers of the cows  along one wall.  Burger put his lantern down on the ground, and  shaded its light in all directions save one by draping his overcoat  round it. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "It might excite remark if anyone saw a light in this lonely  place," said he.  "Just help me to move this boarding." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The flooring was loose in the corner, and plank by plank the  two savants raised it and leaned it against the wall.  Below there  was a square aperture and a stair of old stone steps which led away  down into the bowels of the earth. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Be careful!" cried Burger, as Kennedy, in his impatience,  hurried down them.  "It is a perfect rabbits'-warren below, and if  you were once to lose your way there the chances would be a hundred  to one against your ever coming out again.  Wait until I bring the  light." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "How do you find your own way if it is so complicated?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I had some very narrow escapes at first, but I have gradually  learned to go about.  There is a certain system to it, but it is  one which a lost man, if he were in the dark, could not possibly  find out.  Even now I always spin out a ball of string behind me  when I am going far into the catacomb.  You can see for yourself  that it is difficult, but every one of these passages divides and  subdivides a dozen times before you go a hundred yards." </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        They had descended some twenty feet from the level of the byre,  and they were standing now in a square chamber cut out of the soft  tufa.  The lantern cast a flickering light, bright below and  dim above, over the cracked brown walls.  In every direction  were the black openings of passages which radiated from this common  centre. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I want you to follow me closely, my friend," said Burger.  "Do  not loiter to look at anything upon the way, for the place to which  I will take you contains all that you can see, and more.  It will  save time for us to go there direct." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He led the way down one of the corridors, and the Englishman  followed closely at his heels.  Every now and then the passage  bifurcated, but Burger was evidently following some secret marks of  his own, for he neither stopped nor hesitated.  Everywhere along  the walls, packed like the berths upon an emigrant ship, lay the  Christians of old Rome.  The yellow light flickered over the  shrivelled features of the mummies, and gleamed upon rounded skulls  and long, white armbones crossed over fleshless chests.  And  everywhere as he passed Kennedy looked with wistful eyes upon  inscriptions, funeral vessels, pictures, vestments, utensils, all  lying as pious hands had placed them so many centuries ago.  It was  apparent to him, even in those hurried, passing glances, that this  was the earliest and finest of the catacombs, containing such a  storehouse of Roman remains as had never before come at one time  under the observation of the student. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "What would happen if the light went out?" he asked, as they  hurried onwards. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I have a spare candle and a box of matches in my pocket.  By  the way, Kennedy, have you any matches?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "No; you had better give me some." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Oh, that is all right.  There is no chance of our separating." </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "How far are we going?  It seems to me that we have walked at  least a quarter of a mile." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "More than that, I think.  There is really no limit to the  tombs - at least, I have never been able to find any.  This is a  very difficult place, so I think that I will use our ball of  string." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He fastened one end of it to a projecting stone and he carried  the coil in the breast of his coat, paying it out as he advanced.   Kennedy saw that it was no unnecessary precaution, for the passages  had become more complex and tortuous than ever, with a perfect  network of intersecting corridors.  But these all ended in one  large circular hall with a square pedestal of tufa topped with a  slab of marble at one end of it. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "By Jove!" cried Kennedy in an ecstasy, as Burger swung his  lantern over the marble.  "It is a Christian altar - probably the  first one in existence.  Here is the little consecration cross cut  upon the corner of it.  No doubt this circular space was used as a  church." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Precisely," said Burger.  "If I had more time I should like to  show you all the bodies which are buried in these niches upon the  walls, for they are the early popes and bishops of the Church, with  their mitres, their croziers, and full canonicals.  Go over to that  one and look at it!" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Kennedy went across, and stared at the ghastly head which lay  loosely on the shredded and mouldering mitre. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "This is most interesting," said he, and his voice seemed to  boom against the concave vault.  "As far as my experience goes, it  is unique.  Bring the lantern over, Burger, for I want to see them  all." </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        But the German had strolled away, and was standing in the  middle of a yellow circle of light at the other side of the hall. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Do you know how many wrong turnings there are between this and  the stairs?" he asked.  "There are over two thousand.  No doubt it  was one of the means of protection which the Christians adopted.   The odds are two thousand to one against a man getting out, even if  he had a light; but if he were in the dark it would, of course, be  far more difficult." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "So I should think." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "And the darkness is something dreadful.  I tried it once for  an experiment.  Let us try it again!"  He stooped to the lantern,  and in an instant it was as if an invisible hand was squeezed  tightly over each of Kennedy's eyes.  Never had he known what such  darkness was.  It seemed to press upon him and to smother him.  It  was a solid obstacle against which the body shrank from advancing.   He put his hands out to push it back from him. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "That will do, Burger," said he, "let's have the light again." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        But his companion began to laugh, and in that circular room the  sound seemed to come from every side at once. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "You seem uneasy, friend Kennedy," said he. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Go on, man, light the candle!" said Kennedy impatiently. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "It's very strange, Kennedy, but I could not in the least tell  by the sound in which direction you stand.  Could you tell where I  am?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "No; you seem to be on every side of me." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "If it were not for this string which I hold in my hand I  should not have a notion which way to go." </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I dare say not.  Strike a light, man, and have an end of this  nonsense." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Well, Kennedy, there are two things which I understand that  you are very fond of.  The one is an adventure, and the other is an  obstacle to surmount.  The adventure must be the finding of your  way out of this catacomb.  The obstacle will be the darkness and  the two thousand wrong turns which make the way a little difficult  to find.  But you need not hurry, for you have plenty of time, and  when you halt for a rest now and then, I should like you just to  think of Miss Mary Saunderson, and whether you treated her quite  fairly." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "You devil, what do you mean?" roared Kennedy.  He was running  about in little circles and clasping at the solid blackness with  both hands. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Good-bye," said the mocking voice, and it was already at some  distance.  "I really do not think, Kennedy, even by your own  showing that you did the right thing by that girl.  There was only  one little thing which you appeared not to know, and I can supply  it.  Miss Saunderson was engaged to a poor ungainly devil of a  student, and his name was Julius Burger." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        There was a rustle somewhere, the vague sound of a foot  striking a stone, and then there fell silence upon that old  Christian church - a stagnant, heavy silence which closed round  Kennedy and shut him in like water round a drowning man. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Some two months afterwards the following paragraph made the  round of the European Press: </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "One of the most interesting discoveries of recent years is  that of the new catacomb in Rome, which lies some distance to the  east of the well-known vaults of St. Calixtus.  The finding of this  important burial-place, which is exceeding rich in most  interesting early Christian remains, is due to the energy and  sagacity of Dr. Julius Burger, the young German specialist, who is  rapidly taking the first place as an authority upon ancient Rome.   Although the first to publish his discovery, it appears that a less  fortunate adventurer had anticipated Dr. Burger.  Some months ago  Mr. Kennedy, the well-known English student, disappeared suddenly  from his rooms in the Corso, and it was conjectured that his  association with a recent scandal had driven him to leave Rome.  It  appears now that he had in reality fallen a victim to that fervid  love of archaeology which had raised him to a distinguished place  among living scholars.  His body was discovered in the heart of the  new catacomb, and it was evident from the condition of his feet and  boots that he had tramped for days through the tortuous corridors  which make these subterranean tombs so dangerous to explorers.  The  deceased gentleman had, with inexplicable rashness, made his way  into this labyrinth without, as far as can be discovered, taking  with him either candles or matches, so that his sad fate was the  natural result of his own temerity.  What makes the matter more  painful is that Dr. Julius Burger was an intimate friend of the  deceased.  His joy at the extraordinary find which he has been so  fortunate as to make has been greatly marred by the terrible fate  of his comrade and fellow-worker."</div>
