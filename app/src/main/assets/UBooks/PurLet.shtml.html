Auguste Dupin, in his little back library, or book-closet, au       troisieme, No. 33, Rue Dunot, Faubourg St Germain. For one hour       at least we had maintained a profound silence; while each, to       any casual observer, might have seemed intently and exclusively       occupied with the curling eddies of smoke that oppressed the       atmosphere of the chamber. For myself, however, I was mentally       discussing certain topics which had formed matter for       conversation between us at an earlier period of the evening; I       mean the affair of the Rue Morgue, and the mystery attending       the murder of Marie Roget. I looked upon it, therefore, as       something of a coincidence, when the door of our apartment was       thrown open and admitted our old acquaintance, Monsieur G-, the       Prefect of the Parisian police.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        We gave him a hearty welcome; for there       was nearly half as much of the entertaining as of the       contemptible about the man, and we had not seen him for several       years. We had been sitting in the dark, and Dupin now arose for       the purpose of lighting a lamp, but sat down again, without       doing so, upon G.'s saying that he had called to consult us, or       rather to ask the opinion of my friend, about some official       business which had occasioned a great deal of       trouble.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'If it is any point requiring       reflection,' observed Dupin, as he forbore to enkindle the       wick, 'we shall examine it to better purpose in the       dark.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'That is another of your odd notions,'       said the Prefect, who had a fashion of calling every thing       'odd' that was beyond his comprehension, and thus lived amid an       absolute legion of 'oddities'.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'Very true,' said Dupin, as he supplied       his visitor with a pipe, and rolled towards him a comfortable       chair.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'And what is the difficulty now?' I       asked, 'Nothing more in the assassination way, I       hope?'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'Oh no; nothing of that nature. The fact       is, the business is very simple indeed, and I make no doubt       that we can mange if sufficiently well ourselves; but then I       thought Dupin would like to hear the details of it, because it       is so excessively odd'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'Simple and odd,' said Dupin.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'Why, yes; and not exactly that, either.       The fact is, we have all been a good deal puzzled because the       affair is so simple, and yet baffles us altogether.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'Perhaps it is the very simplicity of the       thing which puts you at fault,' said my friend.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'What nonsense you do talk!' replied the       Prefect, laughing heartily.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'Perhaps the mystery is a little too       plain,' said Dupin.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'Oh, good heavens! who ever heard of such       an idea?'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'A little too self-evident.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'Ha! ha! ha! - ha! ha! ha! - ho! ho! ho!'       - roared our visitor, profoundly amused, 'oh, Dupin, you will       be the death of me yet!'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'And what, after all, is the matter on       hand?' I asked.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'Why, I will tell you,' replied the       Prefect, as he gave a long, steady, and contemplative puff, and       settled himself in his chair. 'I will tell you in a few words;       but, before I begin, let me caution you that this is an affair       demanding the greatest secrecy, and that I should most probably       lose the position I now hold, were it known that I confided it       to any one.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'Proceed,' said I.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'Or not,' said Dupin.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'Well, then; I have received personal       information, from a very high quarter, that a certain document       of the last importance, has been purloined from the royal       apartments. The individual who purloined it is known; this       beyond a doubt; he was seen to take it. It is known, also, that       it still remains in his possession.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'How is this known?' asked       Dupin.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'It is clearly inferred,' replied the       Prefect, 'from the nature of the document, and from the       non-appearance of certain results which would at once arise       from its passing out of the robber's possession; - that is to       say, from his employing it as he must design in the end to       employ it.'</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'Be a little more explicit,' I       said.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'Well, I may venture so far as to say       that the paper gives its holder a certain power in a certain       quarter where such power is immensely valuable.' The Prefect       was fond of the cant of diplomacy.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'Still I do not quite understand,' said       Dupin.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'No? Well; the disclosure of the document       to a third person, who shall be nameless, would bring in       question the honour of a personage of most exalted station; and       this fact gives the holder of the document an ascendancy over       the illustrious personage whose honour and peace are so       jeopardised.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'But this ascendancy,' I interposed,       'would depend upon the robber's knowledge of the loser's       knowledge of the robber. Who would dare-'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'The thief,' said G., 'is the Minister       D-, who dares all things, those unbecoming as well as those       becoming a man. The method of the theft was not less ingenious       than bold. The document in question - a letter, to be frank -       had been received by the personage robbed while alone in the       royal boudoir. During its perusal she was suddenly interrupted       by the entrance of the other exalted personage from whom       especially it was her wish to conceal it. After a hurried and       vain endeavour to thrust it in a drawer, she was forced to       place it, open as it was, upon a table. The address, however,       was uppermost, and, the contents thus unexposed, the letter       escaped notice. At this juncture enter the Minister D-. His       lynx eye immediately perceives the paper, recognises the       handwriting of the address, observes the confusion of the       personage addressed, and fathoms her secret. After some       business transactions, hurried through in his ordinary manner,       he produces a letter somewhat similar to the one in question,       opens it, pretends to read it, and then places it in close       juxtaposition to the other. Again he converses, for some       fifteen minutes, upon the public affairs. At length, in taking       leave, he takes also from the table the letter to which he had       no claim. Its rightful owner saw, but of course, dared no call       attention to the act, in the presence of the third personage       who stood at her elbow. The minister decamped; leaving his own       letter - one of no importance - upon the table.'</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'Here, then,' said Dupin to me, 'you have       precisely what you demand to make the ascendancy complete - the       robber's knowledge of the loser's knowledge of the       robber.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'Yes,' replied the Prefect; 'and the       power thus attained has for some months past, been wielded, for       political purposes, to a very dangerous extent. The personage       robbed is more thoroughly convinced, every day, of the       necessity of reclaiming her letter. But this, of course, cannot       be done openly. In fine, driven to despair, she has committed       the matter to me.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'Than whom,' said Dupin, amid a perfect       whirlwind of smoke, 'no more sagacious agent could, I suppose,       be desired, or even imagined.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'You flatter me,' replied the Prefect;       'but it is possible that some such opinion may have been       entertained.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'It is clear,' said I, 'as you observe,       that the letter is still in possession of the minister; since       it is this possession, and not any employment of the letter,       which bestows the power. With the employment the power       departs.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'True,' said G.; 'and upon this       conviction I proceeded. My first care was to make thorough       search of the minister's hotel; and here my chief embarrassment       lay in the necessity of searching without his knowledge. Beyond       all things, I have been warded of the danger which would result       from giving him reason to suspect our design.'</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'But,' said I, 'you are quite au fait in       these investigations. The Parisian police have done this thing       often before.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'O yes; and for this reason I did not       despair. The habits of the minister gave me, too, a great       advantage. He is frequently absent from home all night. His       servants are by no means numerous. They sleep at a distance       from their master's apartment, and being chiefly Neapolitans,       are readily made drunk. I have keys, as you know, with which I       can open any chamber or cabinet in Paris. For three months a       night has not passed, during the greater part of which I have       not been engaged, personally, in ransacking the D- Hotel. My       honour is interested, and to mention a great secret, the reward       is enormous. So I did not abandon the search until I had become       fully satisfied that the thief is a more astute man than       myself. I fancy that I have investigated every nook and corner       of the premises in which it is possible that the paper can be       concealed.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'But is it not possible,' I suggested,       'that although the letter may be in possession of the minister,       as it unquestionably is, he may have concealed it elsewhere       than upon his own premises?'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'This is barely possible,' said Dupin.       'The present peculiar condition of affairs at court, and       especially of those intrigues in which D- is known to be       involved, would render the instant availability of the document       - its susceptibility of being produced at a moment's notice - a       point of nearly equal importance with its       possession.'</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'Its susceptibility of being produced?'       said I.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'That is to say, of being destroyed,'       said Dupin.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'True,' I observed; 'the paper is clearly       then upon the premises. As for its being upon the person of the       minister, we may consider that as out of the       question.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'Entirely,' said the Prefect. 'He has       been twice waylaid, as if by footpads, and his person       rigorously searched under my own inspection.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'You might have spared yourself this       trouble,' said Dupin. 'D-, I presume, is not altogether a fool,       and if not, must have anticipated these waylaying, as a matter       of course.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'Not altogether a fool,' said G., 'but       then he's a poet, which I take to be only one remove from a       fool.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'True,' said Dupin, after a long and       thoughtful whiff from his meerschaum, 'although I have been       guilty of certain doggerel myself.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'Suppose you detail,' said I, 'the       particulars of your search.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'Why the fact is, we took our time, and       we searched every where. I have had long experience in these       affairs. I took the entire building, room by room; devoting the       nights of a while week to each. We examined, first, the       furniture of each apartment. We opened every possible drawer;       and I presume you know that, to a properly trained police       agent, such a thing as a secret drawer is impossible. Any man       is a dolt who permits a "secret" drawer to escape him in a       search of this kind. The thing is so plain. There is a certain       amount of bulk - of space - to be accounted for in every       cabinet. Then we have accurate rules. The fiftieth part of a       line could not escape up. After the cabinets we took the       chairs. The cushions we probed with the fine long needles you       have seen me employ. From the tables we removed the       tops.'</p></div>

Had there been any traces of recent       disturbance we should not have failed to detect it instantly. A       single grain of gimlet-dust, for example, would have been as       obvious as an apple.

The latter examined it       carefully and deposited it in his pocket-book; then, unlocking       an escritoire, took thence a letter and gave it to the Prefect.       This functionary grasped it in a perfect agony of joy, opened       it with a trembling hand, cast a rapid glance at its contents,       and then, scrambling and struggling to the door, rushed at       length unceremoniously from the room and from the house,       without having uttered a syllable since Dupin had requested him       to fill up the check.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        When he had gone, my friend entered into       some explanations.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The Parisian police,' he said, 'are       exceedingly able in their way. They are persevering, ingenious,       cunning, and thoroughly versed in the knowledge which their       duties seem chiefly to demand. Thus, when G- detailed to us his       mode of searching the premises at the Hotel D-, I felt entire       confidence in his having made a satisfactory investigation - so       far as his labours extended.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'So far as his labours extended?' said       I.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'Yes,' said Dupin. 'The measures adopted       were not only the best of their kind, but carried out to       absolute perfection. Had the letter been deposited within the       range of their search, these fellows would, beyond a question,       have found it.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I merely laughed - but he seemed quite       serious in all that he said.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'The measures, the,' he continued, 'were       good in their kind, and well executed; their defect lay in       their being inapplicable to the case, and to the man. A certain       set of highly ingenious resources are, with the Prefect, a sort       of Procrustean bed, to which he forcibly adapts his designs.       But he perpetually errs by being too deep or too shallow, for       the matter in hand; and many a schoolboy is a better reasoner       than he. I knew one about eight years of age, whose success at       guessing in the game of "even and odd" attracted universal       admiration. This game is simple, and is played with marble. One       player holds in his hand a number of these toys, and demands of       another whether that number is even or odd. If the guess is       right, the guesser wins one; if wrong, he loses one. The boy to       whom I allude won all the marbles of the school. Of course he       had some principle of guessing; and his lay in mere observation       and admeasurement of the astuteness of his opponents. for       example, an arrant simpleton is his opponent, and, holding up       his closed hand, asks, "are they even or odd?" Our schoolboy       replies, "odd," and loses; but upon the second trial he wins,       for he then says to himself, "the simpleton had them even upon       the first trial, and his amount of cunning is just sufficient       to make him have then odd upon the second; I will therefore       guess odd;" - he guesses odd, and wins. Now, with a simpleton a       degree above the first, he would have reasoned thus: "This       fellow finds that in the first instance I guessed odd, and, in       the second, he will propose to himself upon the first       simpleton; but then a second thought will suggest that this is       to simple a variation, and finally he will decide upon putting       it even as before. I will therefore guess even" - he guesses       even, and wins. Now this mode of reasoning in the schoolboy,       whom his fellows termed "lucky," - what, in its last analysis,       is it?'</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'It is merely,' I said, 'an       identification of the reasoner's intellect with that of his       opponent.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'It is,' said Dupin; 'and, upon inquiring       of the boy by what means he effected the thorough       identification in which his success consisted, I received       answer as follows: "When I wish to find out how wise, or how       stupid, or how good, or how wicked is any one, or what are his       thoughts at the moment, I fashion the expression of my face, as       accurately as possible in accordance with the expression of       his, and then wait to see what thoughts or sentiments arise in       my mind or heart, as if to match or correspond with the       expression." This response of the schoolboy lies at the bottom       of all the spurious profundity which has been attributed to       Rochefoucauld, to La Bougive, to Machiavelli, and to       Campanella.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'And the identification,' I said, 'of the       reasoner's intellect with that of his opponent, depends, if I       understand you aright, upon the accuracy with which the       opponent's intellect is admeasured.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'For its practical value it depends upon       this,' replied Dupin; 'and the Prefect and his cohort fail so       frequently, first, by default of this identification, and       secondly, by ill-admeasurment, or rather through       non-admeasurement, of the intellect with which they are       engaged. They consider only their own ideas of ingenuity; and,       in searching for anything hidden, advert only to the modes in       which they would have hidden it. They are right in this much -       that their own ingenuity is a faithful representative of that       of the mass; but when the cunning of the individual felon is       diverse in character from their own, the felon foils them, of       course. This always happens when it is above their own, and       very usually when it is below. They have no variation of       principle in their investigations; at best, when urged by some       unusual emergency - by some extraordinary reward - they extend       or exaggerate their old modes of practice, without touching       their principles. What, for example, in this case of D-, has       been done to vary the principle of action? What is all this       boring, and probing, and sounding, and scrutinising with the       microscope, and dividing the surface of the building into       registered square inches - what is it all but an exaggeration       of the application of the one principle of set of principles of       search, which are based upon the one set of notions regarding       human ingenuity, to which the Prefect, in the long routine of       his duty, has been accustomed?</p></div>

And do you not see also,       that such recherch&eacute;s nooks for concealment are adapted       only for ordinary intellects; for in all cases of concealment,       a disposal of the article concealed - a disposal of it in this       recherch&eacute; manner, - is in the very first instance,       presumable and presumed; and thus its discovery depends, not at       all upon the acumen, but altogether upon the mere care,       patience, and determination of the seekers; and where the case       is of importance - or, what amounts to the same thing in the       policial eyes, when the reward is of magnitude, - the qualities       in question have never been known to fail. You will now       understand what I meant in suggesting that, had the purloined       letter been hidden any where within the limits of the Prefect's       examination - in other words, had the principle of its       concealment been comprehended within the principles of the       Prefect - its discovery would have been a matter altogether       beyond question. This functionary, however, had been thoroughly       mystified; and the remote source of his defeat lies in the       supposition that the Minister is a fool, because he has       acquired renown as a poet. All fools are poets; this the       Prefect feels; and he is merely guilty of a non distributio       medii in thence inferring that al poets are fools.'</p></div>

He is a mathematician,       and no poet.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'You are mistaken; I know him well; he is       both. As poet and mathematician, he would reason well; as mere       mathematician, he could not have reasoned at all, and thus       would have been at the mercy of the Prefect.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'You surprise me,' I said, 'by these       opinions, which have been contradicted by the voice of the       world.

The mathematicians, I grant you, have done their       best to promulgate the popular error to which you allude, and       which is none the less an error for its promulgation as truth.       With an art worthy a better cause, for example they have       insinuated the term "analysis" into application to algebra. The       French are the originators of this particular deception; but if       a term is of any importance - if words derive any value from       applicability - then "analysis" conveys "algebra" about as much       as, in Latin, "ambitus" implies "ambition," "religio,"       "religion," or "homines honesti," a set of honorable       men.'</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'You have a quarrel on hand, I see,' said       I, 'with some of the algebraists of Paris; but       proceed.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'I dispute the availability, and thus the       value, of that reason which is cultivated in any especial form       other than the abstractly logical. I dispute, in particular,       the reason educed by mathematical study. The mathematics are       the science of form and quantity; mathematical reasoning is       merely logic applied to observation upon form and quantity. The       great error lies in supposing that even the truths of what is       called pure algebra, are abstract or general truths. And this       error is so egregious that I am confounded at the universality       with which it has been received. Mathematical axioms are not       axioms of general truth. What is true of relation - of form and       quantity - is often grossly false in regard to morals, for       example. In this latter science it is very usually untrue that       the aggregated parts are equal to the motive it fails; for two       motives, each of a given value, have not, necessarily, a value       when united, equal to the sum of their values apart. There are       numerous other mathematical truths which are only truths within       the limits of relation. But the mathematician argues, from his       finite truths, through habit, as if they were of an absolutely       general applicability - as the world indeed imagines them to       be. Bryant, in his very learned "Mythology," mentions an       analogous source of error, when he says that "although the       Pagan fables are not believed, yet we forget ourselves       continually, and make inferences from them as existing       realities." With the algebraists, however, who are Pagans       themselves, the "Pagan fables" are believed, and the inferences       are made, no so much through lapse of memory, as through an       unaccountable addling of the brains. In short, I never yet       encountered the mere mathematician who could be trusted out of       equal roots, or one who did not clandestinely hold it as a       point of his faith that x^2+px was absolutely and       unconditionally equal to q.

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'I mean to say,' continued Dupin, while I       merely laughed at his last observations, 'that if the Minister       had been no more than a mathematician, the Prefect would have       been under no necessity of giving me this check. I knew him,       however, as both mathematician and poet, and my measures were       adapted to his capacity, with reference to the circumstances by       which he was surrounded. I knew him as a courtier, too, and as       a bold intriguant. Such a man, I considered could not fail to       be aware of the ordinary political modes of action. He could       not have failed to anticipate - and events have proved that he       did not fail to anticipate - the waylayings to which he was       subjected. He must have foreseen, I reflected, the secret       investigations of his premises. His frequent absences from home       at night, which were hailed by the Prefect as certain aids to       his success, I regarded only as ruses, to afford opportunity       for thorough search to the police, and thus the sooner to       impress them with the conviction to which G-, in fact did       finally arrive - the conviction that the letter was not upon       the premises. I felt, also that the whole train of thought,       which I was at some pains in detailing to you just now,       concerning the invariable principle of political action in       searches for articles concealed - I felt that this whole train       of thought would necessarily pass through the mind of the       Minister. It would imperatively lead him to despise all the       ordinary nooks of concealment. He could not, I reflected, be so       weak as not to see that the most intricate and remote recess of       his hotel would be as open as his commonest closets to the       eyes, to the probes, to the gimlets, and to the microscopes of       the Prefect. I saw, in fine, that he would be driven, as a       matter of course, to simplicity, if not deliberately induced to       it as a matter of choice. You will remember, perhaps, how       desperately the Prefect laughed when I suggested, upon our       first interview, that it was just possible this mystery       troubled him so much on account of its being so very       self-evident.'</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'Yes,' said I, 'I remember his merriment       well. I really thought he would have fallen into       convulsions.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'The material world,' continued Dupin,       'abounds with very strict analogies to the immaterial; and thus       some color of truth has been given to the rhetorical dogma,       that metaphor, or simile, may be made to strengthen an       argument, as well as to embellish a description. The principle       of this vis inertiae, for example, seems to be identical in       physics and metaphysics. It is not more true in the former,       that a large body is with more difficulty set in motion that a       smaller one, and that its subsequent momentum is commensurate       with this difficulty, than it is, in the latter, that       intellects of the vaster capacity, while more forcible, more       constant, and more eventful in their movements than those of       inferior grade, are yet the less readily moved, and more       embarrassed and full of hesitation in the first few steps of       their progress. Again: have you ever noticed which of the       street signs, over the shop doors, are the most attractive of       attention?'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'I have never given the matter a       thought,' I said.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'There is a game of puzzles,' he resumed,       'which is played upon a map. One party requires another to find       a given word - the name of town, river, state or empire - any       word, in short, upon the motley and perplexed surface of the       chart. A novice in the game generally seeks to embarrass his       opponents by giving them the most minutely lettered names; but       the adept selects such words as stretch, in large characters,       from one end of the chart to the other. These, like the       over-largely lettered signs and placards of the street, escape       observation by dint of being excessively obvious; and here the       physical oversight is precisely analogous with the moral       inapprehension by which the intellect suffers to pass unnoticed       those considerations which are too obtrusively and too palpably       self-evident. But this is a point, it appears, somewhat above       or beneath the understanding of the Prefect. He never once       thought it probable, or possible, that the Minister had       deposited the letter immediately beneath the nose of the whole       world by way of best preventing any portion of that world from       perceiving it.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'But the more I reflected upon the       daring, dashing, and discriminating ingenuity of D-; upon the       fact that the document must always have been at hand, if he       intended to use it to good purpose; and upon the decisive       evidence, obtained by the Prefect, that it was not hidden       within the limits of that dignitary's ordinary search - the       more satisfied I became that, to conceal this letter, the       Minister had resorted to the comprehensive and sagacious       expedient of not attempting to conceal it at all.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'Full of these ideas, I prepared myself       with a pair of green spectacles, and called one fine morning,       quite by accident, at the Ministerial hotel. I found D- at       home, yawning, lounging, and dawdling, as usual, and pretending       to be in the last extremity of ennui. He is, perhaps, the most       really energetic human being now alive - but that is only when       nobody sees him.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'To be even with him, I complained of my       weak eyes, and lamented the necessity of the spectacles, under       cover of which I cautiously and thoroughly surveyed the       apartment, while seemingly intent only upon the conversation of       my host.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'I paid special attention to a large       writing-table near which he sat, and upon which lay confusedly,       some miscellaneous letters and other papers, with one or two       musical instruments and a few books. Here, however, after along       and very deliberate scrutiny, I saw nothing to excite       particular suspicion.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'At length my eyes, in going the circuit       of the room, fell upon a trumpery fillagree card-rack of       pasteboard, that hung dangling by a dirty blue ribbon, from a       little brass knob just beneath the middle of the mantelpiece.       In this rack, which had three or four compartments, were five       or six visiting cards and a solitary letter. This last was much       soiled and crumpled. It was torn nearly in two, across the       middle - as if a design, in the first instance, to tear it       entirely up as worthless, had been altered, or stayed, in the       second. It had a large black seal, bearing the D- cipher very       conspicuously, and was addressed, in diminutive female hand, to       D-, the minister, himself. It was thrust carelessly, and even,       as it seemed, contemptuously, into one of the upper divisions       of the rack.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'No sooner had I glanced at this letter,       than I concluded it to be that of which I was in search. To be       sure, it was, to all appearance, radically different from the       one which the Prefect had read us so minute a description. Here       the seal was large and black, with the D- cipher; there it was       small and red, with the ducal arms of the S- family. Here, the       address, to the Minister, was diminutive and feminine; there       the superscription, to a certain royal personage, was markedly       bold and decided; the size alone formed a point of       correspondence. But, then, the radicalness of these       differences, which was excessive; the dirt; the soiled and torn       condition of the paper, so inconsistent with the true       methodical habits of D-, and so suggestive of a design to       delude the beholder into an idea of the worthlessness of the       document; these things, together with the hyperobtrusive       situation of this document, full in the view of every visitor,       and thus exactly in accordance with the conclusions to which I       had previously arrived; these things, I say, were strongly       corroborative of suspicion, in one who came with the intention       to suspect.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'I protracted my visit as long as       possible, and while I maintained a most animated discussion       with the Minister, on a topic which I knew well had very failed       to interest and excite him, I kept my attention really riveted       upon the letter. In this examination, I committed to memory its       external appearance and arrangement in the rack; and also fell,       at length, upon a discovery which set at rest whatever trivial       doubt I might have entertained. In scrutinising the edges of       the paper, I observed them to be more chafed than seemed       necessary. They presented the broken appearance which is       manifested when a stiff paper, having been folded and pressed       with a folder, is refolded in a reversed direction, in the same       creases or edges which had formed the original fold. This       discovery was sufficient. It was clear to me that the letter       had been turned, as a glove, inside out, redirected, and       re-sealed. I bade the Minister good morning, and took my       departure at once, leaving a gold snuff-box upon the       table.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The next morning I called for the       snuff-box, when we resumed, quite eagerly, the conversation of       the preceding day. While thus engaged, however, a loud report,       as if of a pistol, was heard immediately beneath the windows of       the hotel, and was succeeded by a series of fearful screams,       and the shoutings of a mob. D- rushed to a casement, threw it       open, and looked out. In the meantime, I stepped to the       card-rack, took the letter, put it in my pocket, and replaced       it by a fac-simile, (so far as regards externals,) which I had       carefully prepared at my lodgings; imitating the D- cipher,       very readily, by means of a seal formed of bread.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'The disturbance in the street had been       occasioned by the frantic behaviour of a man with a musket. He       had fired it among a crowd of women and children. I proved,       however, to have been without ball, and the fellow was suffered       to go his way as a lunatic or a drunkard. When he had gone, D-       came from the window, whither I had followed him immediately       upon securing the object in view. Soon afterwards I bade him       farewell. The pretended lunatic was a man in my own       pay.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'But what purpose had you,' I asked, 'in       replacing the letter by a fac-simile? Would it not have been       better, at the first visit, to have seized it openly, and       departed.'</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'D-,' replied Dupin, 'is a desperate man,       and a man of nerve. His hotel, too, is not without attendants       devoted to his interests. Had I made the wild attempt you       suggest, I might never have left the Ministerial presence       alive. The good people of Paris might have heard of me no more.       But I had an object apart from these considerations. You know       my political prepossessions. In this matter, I act as a       partisan of the lady concerned. for eighteen months the       Minister has had her in his power. She has not him in hers;       since, being unaware that the letter is not in his possession,       he will proceed with his exactions as if it was. Thus will be       inevitably commit himself, at once, to his political       destruction. His downfall, too, will not be more precipitate       than awkward. It is all very well to talk about the facilis       descensus Averni; but in all kinds of climbing, as Catalani       said of singing, it is far more easy to get up than to come       down. In the present instance I have no sympathy - at least no       pity - for him who descends. He is that monstrum horrendum, an       unprincipled man of genius. I confess, however, that I should       like very well to know the precise character of his thoughts,       when, being defied by her whom the Prefect terms "a certain       personage," he is reduced to opening the letter which I left       for him in the card-rack.'</p></div>

D-, at Vienna once, did me an evil turn, which I told him,       quite good-humoredly, that I should remember. So, as I knew he       would feel some curiosity in regard to the identity of the       person who had outwitted him, I thought it a pity not to give       him a clue.
