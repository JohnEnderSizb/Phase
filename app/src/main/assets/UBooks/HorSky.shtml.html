<div class="story_text" id="1"><p>One sunny afternoon in the autumn of   the year 1861 a soldier lay in clump of laurel by the side of a road in western Virginia.  He lay at full length upon his stomach, his feet resting upon the toes, his head upon the left forearm. His extended right hand loosely grasped his rifle. But for the somewhat methodical disposition of his limbs and a slight rhythmic movement of the cartridge-box at   the back of his belt, he might have been thought to be dead. He was asleep at his post of   duty. But if detected he would be dead shortly afterward, death being the just and legal   penalty of his crime. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The clump of laurel in which the criminal lay   was in the angle of a road which after ascending southward a steep acclivity to that point   turned sharply to the west, running along the summit for perhaps one hundred yards. There   it turned southward again and went zigzagging downward through the forest. At the salient   of that second angle was a large flat rock, jutting out northward, overlooking the deep   valley from which the road ascended. The rock capped a high cliff; a stone dropped from   its outer edge would have fallen sheer downward one thousand feet to the tops of the   pines. The angle where the soldier lay was on another spur of the same cliff. Had he been   awake he would have commanded a view, not only of the short arm of the road and the   jutting rock, but of the entire profile of the cliff below it. It might well have made him   giddy to look. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The country was wooded everywhere except at the   bottom of the valley to the northward, where there was a small natural meadow, through   which flowed a stream scarcely visible from the valley's rim. This open ground looked   hardly larger than an ordinary door-yard, but was really several acres in extent. Its green was more vivid than that of the enclosing forest. Away beyond it rose a line of   giant cliffs similar to those upon which we are supposed to stand in our survey of the   savage scene, and through which the road had somehow made its climb to the summit. The   configuration of the valley, indeed, was such that from our point of observation it   seemed entirely shut in, and one could but have wondered how the road which found a way   out of it had found a way into it, and whence came and whither went the waters of the   stream that parted the meadow more than a thousand feet below. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        No country is so wild and difficult but men will   make it a theatre of war; concealed in the forest at the bottom of that military rat-trap,   in which half a hundred men in possession of the exits might have starved an army to   submission, lay five regiments of Federal infantry. They had marched all the previous day   and night and were resting. At nightfall they would take to the road again, climb to the   place where their unfaithful sentinel now slept, and descending the other slope of the   ridge fall upon a camp of the enemy at about midnight. Their hope was to surprise it, for   the road led to the rear of it. In case of failure, their position would be perilous in   the extreme; and fall they surely would should accident or vigilance apprise the enemy of   the movement. </p><p>&nbsp;       </p><p>The sleeping sentinel in the clump of   laurel was a young Virginian named Carter Druse. He was the son of wealthy parents, an   only child, and had known such ease and cultivation and high living as wealth and taste   were able to command in the mountain country of western Virginia. His home was but a few   miles from where he now lay. One morning he had risen from the breakfast-table and said,   quietly but gravely: 'Father, a Union regiment has arrived at Grafton. I am going to join it.' </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The father lifted his leonine head, looked at   the son a moment in silence, and replied: 'Go, Carter, and whatever may occur, do what you conceive to be your duty. Virginia, to which you are a traitor, must get on without you. Should we both live to the end of the war, we will speak further of the matter. Your mother, as the physician has informed you, is in a most critical condition;  at the best she cannot be with us longer than a few weeks, but that time is precious. It would be better not to disturb her.' </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        So Carter Druse, bowing reverently to his   father, who returned the salute with a stately courtesy that masked a breaking heart, left   the home of his childhood to go soldiering. By conscience and courage, by deeds of   devotion and daring, he soon commended himself to his fellows and his officers; and it was   to these qualities and to some knowledge of the country that he owed his selection for his   present perilous duty at the extreme outpost. Nevertheless, fatigue had been stronger than   resolution and he had fallen asleep. What good or bad angel came in a dream to rouse him   from his state of crime, who shall say? Without a movement, without a sound, in the   profound silence and the languor of the late afternoon, some invisible messenger of fate   touched with unsealing finger the eyes of his consciousness - whispered into the ear of   his spirit the mysterious awakening word which no human lips ever have spoken, no human   memory ever has recalled. He quietly raised his forehead from his arm and looked between   the masking stems of the laurels, instinctively closing his right hand about the stock of   his rifle. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        His first feeling was a keen artistic delight.   On a colossal pedestal, the cliff, motionless at the extreme edge of the capping rock and sharply outlined against the sky, was an equestrian statue of impressive dignity. The   figure of the man sat the figure of the horse, straight and soldierly, but with the repose   of a Grecian god carved in the marble which limits the suggestion of activity. The gray   costume harmonized with its aerial background; the metal of accoutrement and caparison was   softened and subdued by the shadow; the animal's skin had no points of high light. A carbine strikingly foreshortened lay across the pommel of the saddle, kept in place by the   right hand grasping it at the 'grip;' the left hand, holding the bridle rein,   was invisible. In silhouette against the sky the profile of the horse was cut with the   sharpness of a cameo; it looked across the heights of air to the confronting cliffs   beyond. The face of the rider, turned slightly away, showed only an outline of temple and   beard; he was looking downward to the bottom of the valley. Magnified by its lift against   the sky and by the soldier's testifying sense of the formidableness of a near enemy the group appeared of heroic, almost colossal, size. </p></div>

			<div class="pagers" id="4"><a href="HorSky.shtml.html#3"><b>&lt;</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="HorSky.shtml.html#4">4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="HorSky.shtml.html#5"><b>&gt;</b></a></div>
			
			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        For an instant Druse had a strange, half-defined   feeling that he had slept to the end of the war and was looking upon a noble work of art   reared upon that eminence to commemorate the deeds of an heroic past of which he had been   an inglorious part. The feeling was dispelled by a slight movement of the group: the   horse, without moving its feet, had drawn its body slightly backward from the verge; the   man remained immobile as before. Broad awake and keenly alive to the significance of the   situation, Druse now brought the butt of his rifle against his cheek by cautiously pushing   the barrel forward through the bushes, cocked the piece, and glancing through the sights   covered a vital spot of the horseman's breast. A touch upon the trigger and all would have   been well with Carter Druse. At that instant the horseman turned his head and looked in   the direction of his concealed foeman - seemed to look into his very face, into his eyes,   into his brave, compassionate heart. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Is it then so terrible to kill an enemy in war  - an enemy who has surprised a secret vital to the safety of one's self and comrades - an enemy more formidable for his knowledge than all his army for its numbers? Carter Druse grew pale; he shook in every limb, turned faint, and saw the statuesque group before him   as black figures, rising, falling, moving unsteadily in arcs of circles in a fiery sky.   His hand fell away from his weapon, his head slowly dropped until his face rested on the   leaves in which he lay. This courageous gentleman and hardy soldier was near swooning from   intensity of emotion. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        It was not for long; in another moment his face   was raised from earth, his hands resumed their places on the rifle, his forefinger sought   the trigger; mind, heart, and eyes were clear, conscience and reason sound. He could not   hope to capture that enemy; to alarm him would but send him dashing to his camp with his   fatal news. The duty of the soldier was plain: the man must be shot dead from ambush - without warning, without a moment's spiritual preparation, with never so much as an   unspoken prayer, he must be sent to his account. But no - there is a hope; he may have   discovered nothing - perhaps he is but admiring the sublimity of the landscape. If   permitted, he may turn and ride carelessly away in the direction whence he came. Surely it   will be possible to judge at the instant of his withdrawing whether he knows. It may well   be that his fixity of attention - Druse turned his head and looked through the deeps of   air downward, as from the surface to the bottom of a translucent sea. He saw creeping   across the green meadow a sinuous line of figures of men and horses - some foolish   commander was permitting the soldiers of his escort to water their beasts in the open, in   plain view from a dozen summits! </p></div>

			<div class="pagers" id="5"><a href="HorSky.shtml.html#4"><b>&lt;</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="HorSky.shtml.html#5">5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="HorSky.shtml.html#6"><b>&gt;</b></a></div>
			
			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Druse withdrew his eyes from the valley and   fixed them again upon the group of man and horse in the sky, and again it was through the   sights of his rifle. But this time his aim was at the horse. In his memory, as if they   were a divine mandate, rang the words of his father at their parting: 'Whatever may   occur, do what you conceive to be your duty.' He was calm now. His teeth were firmly   but not rigidly closed; his nerves were as tranquil as a sleeping babe's - not a tremor   affected any muscle of his body; his breathing, until suspended in the act of taking aim, was regular and slow. Duty had conquered; the spirit had said to the body: 'Peace, be still.' He fired. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        An officer of the Federal force, who   in a spirit of adventure or in quest of knowledge had left the hidden bivouac in the   valley, and with aimless feet had made his way to the lower edge of a small open space   near the foot of the cliff, was considering what he had to gain by pushing his exploration   further. At a distance of a quarter-mile before him, but apparently at a stone's throw,   rose from its fringe of pines the gigantic face of rock, towering to so great a height   above him that it made him giddy to look up to where its edge cut a sharp, rugged line   against the sky. It presented a clean, vertical profile against a background of blue sky   to a point half the way down, and of distant hills, hardly less blue, thence to the tops   of the trees at its base. Lifting his eyes to the dizzy altitude of its summit the officer   saw an astonishing sight - a man on horseback riding down into the valley through the air! </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Straight upright sat the rider, in military   fashion, with a firm seat in the saddle, a strong clutch upon the rein to hold his charger   from too impetuous a plunge. From his bare head his long hair streamed upward, waving like   a plume. His hands were concealed in the cloud of the horse's lifted mane. The   animal's body was as level as if every hoof-stroke encountered the resistant earth. Its   motions were those of a wild gallop, but even as the officer looked they ceased, with all   the legs thrown sharply forward as in the act of alighting from a leap. But this was a   flight! </p></div>

			<div class="pagers" id="6"><a href="HorSky.shtml.html#5"><b>&lt;</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="HorSky.shtml.html#6">6</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="HorSky.shtml.html#7"><b>&gt;</b></a></div>
			
			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Filled with amazement and terror by this   apparition of a horseman in the sky - half believing himself the chosen scribe of some new   Apocalypse, the officer was overcome by the intensity of his emotions; his legs failed him and he fell. Almost at the same Instant he heard a crashing sound in the trees - a sound that died without an echo, and all was still. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The officer rose to his feet, trembling. The   familiar sensation of an abraded shin recalled his dazed faculties. Pulling himself   together he ran rapidly obliquely away from the cliff to a point distant from its foot;   thereabout he expected to find his man; and thereabout he naturally failed. In the   fleeting instant of his vision his imagination had been so wrought upon by the apparent   grace and ease and intention of the marvelous performance that it did not occur to him   that the line of march of aerial cavalry is directly downward, and that he could find the   objects of his search at the very foot of the cliff. A half-hour later he returned to   camp. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        This officer was a wise man; he knew better than   to tell an incredible truth. He said nothing of what he had seen. But when the commander   asked him if in his scout he had learned anything of advantage to the expedition he   answered: </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'Yes, sir; there is no road leading down   into this valley from the southward.' </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The commander, knowing better, smiled. </p><p>&nbsp;       </p><p>After firing his shot, Private Carter Druse reloaded his rifle and resumed his watch. Ten minutes had hardly passed when a Federal sergeant crept cautiously to him on hands and knees. Druse neither turned his head nor looked at him, but lay without motion or sign of recognition. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'Did you fire?' the sergeant   whispered. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'Yes.' </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'At what?' </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'A horse. It was standing on yonder rock - pretty far out. You see it is no longer there. It went over the cliff.' </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The man's face was white, but he showed no other   sign of emotion. Having answered, he turned away his eyes and said no more. The sergeant   did not understand. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'See here, Druse,' he said, after a   moment's silence, 'it's no use making a mystery. I order you to report. Was there anybody on the horse?' </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'Yes.' </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'Well?' </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        'My father.' </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The sergeant rose to his feet and walked away. 'Good God!' he said.</div>
