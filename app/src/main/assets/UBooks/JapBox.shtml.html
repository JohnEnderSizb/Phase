<div class="story_text" id="1"><p>It <i>was</i> a curious thing, said the private tutor; one of those  grotesque and whimsical incidents which occur to one as one goes  through life.  I lost the best situation which I am ever likely  to have through it.  But I am glad that I went to Thorpe Place,  for I gained - well, as I tell you the story you will learn what I  gained. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I don't know whether you are familiar with that part of the  Midlands which is drained by the Avon.  It is the most English part  of England.  Shakespeare, the flower of the whole race, was born  right in the middle of it.  It is a land of rolling pastures,  rising in higher folds to the westwards, until they swell into the  Malvern Hills.  There are no towns, but numerous villages, each  with its grey Norman church.  You have left the brick of the  southern and eastern counties behind you, and everything is stone - stone for the walls, and lichened slabs of stone for the roofs.  It  is all grim and solid and massive, as befits the heart of a great  nation. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        It was in the middle of this country, not very far from  Evesham, that Sir John Bollamore lived in the old ancestral home of  Thorpe Place, and thither it was that I came to teach his two  little sons.  Sir John was a widower - his wife had died three years  before - and he had been left with these two lads aged eight and  ten, and one dear little girl of seven.  Miss Witherton, who is now  my wife, was governess to this little girl.  I was tutor to the two  boys.  Could there be a more obvious prelude to an engagement?  She  governs me now, and I tutor two little boys of our own.  But,  there - I have already revealed what it was which I gained in Thorpe  Place! </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        It was a very, very old house, incredibly old - pre-Norman, some  of it - and the Bollamores claimed to have lived in that situation  since long before the Conquest.  It struck a chill to my heart when  first I came there, those enormously thick grey walls, the rude  crumbling stones, the smell as from a sick animal which exhaled  from the rotting plaster of the aged building.  But the modern wing  was bright and the garden was well kept.  No house could be dismal  which had a pretty girl inside it and such a show of roses in  front. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Apart from a very complete staff of servants there were only  four of us in the household.  These were Miss Witherton, who was at  that time four-and-twenty and as pretty - well, as pretty as Mrs.  Colmore is now - myself, Frank Colmore, aged thirty, Mrs. Stevens,  the housekeeper, a dry, silent woman, and Mr. Richards, a tall  military-looking man, who acted as steward to the Bollamore  estates.  We four always had our meals together, but Sir John had  his usually alone in the library.  Sometimes he joined us at  dinner, but on the whole we were just as glad when he did not. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        For he was a very formidable person.  Imagine a man six feet  three inches in height, majestically built, with a high-nosed,  aristocratic face, brindled hair, shaggy eyebrows, a small, pointed  Mephistophelian beard, and lines upon his brow and round his eyes  as deep as if they had been carved with a penknife.  He had grey  eyes, weary, hopeless-looking eyes, proud and yet pathetic, eyes  which claimed your pity and yet dared you to show it.  His back was  rounded with study, but otherwise he was as fine a looking man of  his age - five-and-fifty perhaps - as any woman would wish to look  upon. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        But his presence was not a cheerful one.  He was always  courteous, always refined, but singularly silent and retiring.  I  have never lived so long with any man and known so little of him.   If he were indoors he spent his time either in his own small study  in the Eastern Tower, or in the library in the modern wing.  So  regular was his routine that one could always say at any hour  exactly where he would be.  Twice in the day he would visit his  study, once after breakfast, and once about ten at night.  You  might set your watch by the slam of the heavy door.  For the rest  of the day he would be in his library - save that for an hour or two  in the afternoon he would take a walk or a ride, which was solitary  like the rest of his existence.  He loved his children, and was  keenly interested in the progress of their studies, but they were  a little awed by the silent, shaggy-browed figure, and they avoided  him as much as they could.  Indeed, we all did that. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        It was some time before I came to know anything about the  circumstances of Sir John Bollamore's life, for Mrs. Stevens, the  housekeeper, and Mr. Richards, the land-steward, were too loyal to  talk easily of their employer's affairs.  As to the governess, she  knew no more than I did, and our common interest was one of the  causes which drew us together.  At last, however, an incident  occurred which led to a closer acquaintance with Mr. Richards and  a fuller knowledge of the life of the man whom I served. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The immediate cause of this was no less than the falling of  Master Percy, the youngest of my pupils, into the mill-race, with  imminent danger both to his life and to mine, since I had to risk  myself in order to save him.  Dripping and exhausted - for I  was far more spent than the child - I was making for my room when  Sir John, who had heard the hubbub, opened the door of his little  study and asked me what was the matter.  I told him of the  accident, but assured him that his child was in no danger, while he  listened with a rugged, immobile face, which expressed in its  intense eyes and tightened lips all the emotion which he tried to  conceal. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "One moment!  Step in here!  Let me have the details!" said he,  turning back through the open door. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And so I found myself within that little sanctum, inside which,  as I afterwards learned, no other foot had for three years been set  save that of the old servant who cleaned it out.  It was a round  room, conforming to the shape of the tower in which it was  situated, with a low ceiling, a single narrow, ivy-wreathed window,  and the simplest of furniture.  An old carpet, a single chair, a  deal table, and a small shelf of books made up the whole contents.   On the table stood a full-length photograph of a woman - I took no  particular notice of the features, but I remember, that a certain  gracious gentleness was the prevailing impression.  Beside it were  a large black japanned box and one or two bundles of letters or  papers fastened together with elastic bands. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Our interview was a short one, for Sir John Bollamore perceived  that I was soaked, and that I should change without delay.  The  incident led, however, to an instructive talk with Richards, the  agent, who had never penetrated into the chamber which chance had  opened to me.  That very afternoon he came to me, all curiosity,  and walked up and down the garden path with me, while my two  charges played tennis upon the lawn beside us. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "You hardly realize the exception which has been made in your  favour," said he.  "That room has been kept such a mystery, and Sir  John's visits to it have been so regular and consistent, that an  almost superstitious feeling has arisen about it in the household.   I assure you that if I were to repeat to you the tales which are  flying about, tales of mysterious visitors there, and of voices  overheard by the servants, you might suspect that Sir John had  relapsed into his old ways." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Why do you say relapsed?" I asked.   </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He looked at me in surprise. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Is it possible," said he, "that Sir John Bollamore's previous  history is unknown to you?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Absolutely." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "You astound me.  I thought that every man in England knew  something of his antecedents.  I should not mention the matter if  it were not that you are now one of ourselves, and that the facts  might come to your ears in some harsher form if I were silent upon  them.  I always took it for granted that you knew that you were in  the service of 'Devil' Bollamore." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "But why 'Devil'?" I asked. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Ah, you are young and the world moves fast, but twenty  years ago the name of 'Devil' Bollamore was one of the best  known in London.  He was the leader of the fastest set, bruiser,  driver, gambler, drunkard - a survival of the old type, and as bad  as the worst of them." </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I stared at him in amazement. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "What!" I cried, "that quiet, studious, sad-faced man?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The greatest rip and debauchee in England!  All between  ourselves, Colmore.  But you understand now what I mean when I say  that a woman's voice in his room might even now give rise to  suspicions." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "But what can have changed him so?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Little Beryl Clare, when she took the risk of becoming his  wife.  That was the turning point.  He had got so far that his own  fast set had thrown him over.  There is a world of difference, you  know, between a man who drinks and a drunkard.  They all drink, but  they taboo a drunkard.  He had become a slave to it - hopeless and  helpless.  Then she stepped in, saw the possibilities of a fine man  in the wreck, took her chance in marrying him though she might have  had the pick of a dozen, and, by devoting her life to it, brought  him back to manhood and decency.  You have observed that no liquor  is ever kept in the house.  There never has been any since her foot  crossed its threshold.  A drop of it would be like blood to a tiger  even now." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Then her influence still holds him?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "That is the wonder of it.  When she died three years ago, we  all expected and feared that he would fall back into his old ways.   She feared it herself, and the thought gave a terror to death, for  she was like a guardian angel to that man, and lived only for  the one purpose.  By the way, did you see a black japanned box in  his room?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Yes." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I fancy it contains her letters.  If ever he has occasion to  be away, if only for a single night, he invariably takes his black  japanned box with him.  Well, well, Colmore, perhaps I have told  you rather more than I should, but I shall expect you to  reciprocate if anything of interest should come to your knowledge." </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I could see that the worthy man was consumed with curiosity and  just a little piqued that I, the newcomer, should have been the  first to penetrate into the untrodden chamber.  But the fact raised  me in his esteem, and from that time onwards I found myself upon  more confidential terms with him. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And now the silent and majestic figure of my employer became an  object of greater interest to me.  I began to understand that  strangely human look in his eyes, those deep lines upon his care-worn face.  He was a man who was fighting a ceaseless battle,  holding at arm's length, from morning till night, a horrible  adversary who was forever trying to close with him - an adversary  which would destroy him body and soul could it but fix its claws  once more upon him.  As I watched the grim, round-backed figure  pacing the corridor or walking in the garden, this imminent danger  seemed to take bodily shape, and I could almost fancy that I saw  this most loathsome and dangerous of all the fiends crouching  closely in his very shadow, like a half-cowed beast which slinks  beside its keeper, ready at any unguarded moment to spring at his  throat.  And the dead woman, the woman who had spent her life in  warding off this danger, took shape also to my imagination, and I  saw her as a shadowy but beautiful presence which intervened for  ever with arms uplifted to screen the man whom she loved. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        In some subtle way he divined the sympathy which I had for him,  and he showed in his own silent fashion that he appreciated it.  He  even invited me once to share his afternoon walk, and although no  word passed between us on this occasion, it was a mark of  confidence which he had never shown to anyone before.  He asked me  also to index his library (it was one of the best private libraries  in England), and I spent many hours in the evening in his  presence, if not in his society, he reading at his desk and I  sitting in a recess by the window reducing to order the chaos which  existed among his books.  In spite of these close relations I was  never again asked to enter the chamber in the turret. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And then came my revulsion of feeling.  A single incident  changed all my sympathy to loathing, and made me realize that my  employer still remained all that he had ever been, with the  additional vice of hypocrisy.  What happened was as follows. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        One evening Miss Witherton had gone down to Broadway, the  neighbouring village, to sing at a concert for some charity, and I,  according to my promise, had walked over to escort her back.  The  drive sweeps round under the eastern turret, and I observed as I  passed that the light was lit in the circular room.  It was a  summer evening, and the window, which was a little higher than our  heads, was open.  We were, as it happened, engrossed in our own  conversation at the moment and we had paused upon the lawn which  skirts the old turret, when suddenly something broke in upon our  talk and turned our thoughts away from our own affairs. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        It was a voice - the voice undoubtedly of a woman.  It was low - so low that it was only in that still night air that we could have  heard it, but, hushed as it was, there was no mistaking its  feminine timbre.  It spoke hurriedly, gaspingly for a few  sentences, and then was silent - a piteous, breathless, imploring  sort of voice.  Miss Witherton and I stood for an instant staring  at each other.  Then we walked quickly in the direction of the  hall-door. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "It came through the window," I said. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "We must not play the part of eavesdroppers," she answered.   "We must forget that we have ever heard it." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        There was an absence of surprise in her manner which suggested  a new idea to me. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "You have heard it before," I cried. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I could not help it.  My own room is higher up on the same  turret.  It has happened frequently." </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Who can the woman be?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I have no idea.  I had rather not discuss it." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Her voice was enough to show me what she thought.  But granting  that our employer led a double and dubious life, who could she be,  this mysterious woman who kept him company in the old tower?   I knew from my own inspection how bleak and bare a room it was.   She certainly did not live there.  But in that case where did she  come from?  It could not be anyone of the household.  They were all  under the vigilant eyes of Mrs. Stevens.  The visitor must come  from without.  But how? </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And then suddenly I remembered how ancient this building was,  and how probable that some mediaeval passage existed in it.  There  is hardly an old castle without one.  The mysterious room was the  basement of the turret, so that if there were anything of the sort  it would open through the floor.  There were numerous cottages in  the immediate vicinity.  The other end of the secret passage might  lie among some tangle of bramble in the neighbouring copse.  I said  nothing to anyone, but I felt that the secret of my employer lay  within my power. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And the more convinced I was of this the more I marvelled at  the manner in which he concealed his true nature.  Often as I  watched his austere figure, I asked myself if it were indeed  possible that such a man should be living this double life, and I  tried to persuade myself that my suspicions might after all prove  to be ill-founded.  But there was the female voice, there was the  secret nightly rendezvous in the turret-chamber - how could such  facts admit of an innocent interpretation.  I conceived a horror of  the man.  I was filled with loathing at his deep, consistent  hypocrisy. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Only once during all those months did I ever see him without  that sad but impassive mask which he usually presented towards his  fellow-man.  For an instant I caught a glimpse of those volcanic  fires which he had damped down so long.  The occasion was an  unworthy one, for the object of his wrath was none other than the  aged charwoman whom I have already mentioned as being the one  person who was allowed within his mysterious chamber.  I was  passing the corridor which led to the turret - for my own room lay  in that direction - when I heard a sudden, startled scream, and  merged in it the husky, growling note of a man who is inarticulate  with passion.  It was the snarl of a furious wild beast.  Then I  heard his voice thrilling with anger.  "You would dare!" he cried.   "You would dare to disobey my directions!"  An instant later the  charwoman passed me, flying down the passage, white-faced and  tremulous, while the terrible voice thundered behind her.  "Go to  Mrs. Stevens for your money!  Never set foot in Thorpe Place  again!"  Consumed with curiosity, I could not help following the  woman, and found her round the corner leaning against the wall and  palpitating like a frightened rabbit. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "What is the matter, Mrs. Brown?" I asked. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "It's master!" she gasped.  "Oh, 'ow 'e frightened me!  If you  had seen 'is eyes, Mr. Colmore, sir.  I thought 'e would 'ave been  the death of me." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "But what had you done?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Done, sir!  Nothing.  At least nothing to make so much of.   Just laid my 'and on that black box of 'is - 'adn't even opened it,  when in 'e came and you 'eard the way 'e went on.  I've lost my  place, and glad I am of it, for I would never trust myself within  reach of 'im again." </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        So it was the japanned box which was the cause of this  outburst - the box from which he would never permit himself to be  separated.  What was the connection, or was there any connection  between this and the secret visits of the lady whose voice I had  overheard?  Sir John Bollamore's wrath was enduring as well as  fiery, for from that day Mrs. Brown, the charwoman, vanished from  our ken, and Thorpe Place knew her no more. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And now I wish to tell you the singular chance which solved all  these strange questions and put my employer's secret in my  possession.  The story may leave you with some lingering doubts as  to whether my curiosity did not get the better of my honour, and  whether I did not condescend to play the spy.  If you choose to  think so I cannot help it, but can only assure you that, improbable  as it may appear, the matter came about exactly as I describe it. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The first stage in this denouement was that the small room  in the turret became uninhabitable.  This occurred through the fall  of the worm-eaten oaken beam which supported the ceiling.  Rotten  with age, it snapped in the middle one morning, and brought down a  quantity of plaster with it.  Fortunately Sir John was not in the  room at the time.  His precious box was rescued from amongst the  debris and brought into the library, where, henceforward, it was  locked within his bureau.  Sir John took no steps to repair the  damage, and I never had an opportunity of searching for that secret  passage, the existence of which I had surmised.  As to the lady, I  had thought that this would have brought her visits to an end, had  I not one evening heard Mr. Richards asking Mrs. Stevens who the  woman was whom he had overheard talking to Sir John in the library.   I could not catch her reply, but I saw from her manner that it was  not the first time that she had had to answer or avoid the same  question. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "You've heard the voice, Colmore?" said the agent. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I confessed that I had. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "And what do <i>you</i> think of it?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I shrugged my shoulders, and remarked that it was no business  of mine. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Come, come, you are just as curious as any of us.  Is it a  woman or not?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "It is certainly a woman." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Which room did you hear it from?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "From the turret-room, before the ceiling fell." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "But I heard it from the library only last night.  I passed the  doors as I was going to bed, and I heard something wailing and  praying just as plainly as I hear you.  It may be a woman -- " </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Why, what else <i>could</i> it be?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He looked at me hard. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "There are more things in heaven and earth," said he.  "If it  is a woman, how does she get there?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I don't know." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "No, nor I.  But if it is the other thing - but there, for a  practical business man at the end of the nineteenth century this is  rather a ridiculous line of conversation."  He turned away, but I  saw that he felt even more than he had said.  To all the old ghost  stories of Thorpe Place a new one was being added before our very  eyes.  It may by this time have taken its permanent place, for  though an explanation came to me, it never reached the others. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And my explanation came in this way.  I had suffered a  sleepless night from neuralgia, and about midday I had taken a  heavy dose of chlorodyne to alleviate the pain.  At that time I was  finishing the indexing of Sir John Bollamore's library, and it was  my custom to work there from five till seven.  On this particular  day I struggled against the double effect of my bad night and the  narcotic.  I have already mentioned that there was a recess in the  library, and in this it was my habit to work.  I settled down  steadily to my task, but my weariness overcame me and, falling  back upon the settee, I dropped into a heavy sleep. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        How long I slept I do not know, but it was quite dark when I  awoke.  Confused by the chlorodyne which I had taken, I lay  motionless in a semi-conscious state.  The great room with its high  walls covered with books loomed darkly all round me.  A dim  radiance from the moonlight came through the farther window, and  against this lighter background I saw that Sir John Bollamore was  sitting at his study table.  His well-set head and clearly cut  profile were sharply outlined against the glimmering square behind  him.  He bent as I watched him, and I heard the sharp turning of a  key and the rasping of metal upon metal.  As if in a dream I was  vaguely conscious that this was the japanned box which stood in  front of him, and that he had drawn something out of it, something  squat and uncouth, which now lay before him upon the table.  I  never realized - it never occurred to my bemuddled and torpid brain  that I was intruding upon his privacy, that he imagined himself to  be alone in the room.  And then, just as it rushed upon my  horrified perceptions, and I had half risen to announce my  presence, I heard a strange, crisp, metallic clicking, and then the  voice. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Yes, it was a woman's voice; there could not be a doubt of it.   But a voice so charged with entreaty and with yearning love, that  it will ring for ever in my ears.  It came with a curious faraway  tinkle, but every word was clear, though faint - very faint, for  they were the last words of a dying woman. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I am not really gone, John," said the thin, gasping voice.  "I  am here at your very elbow, and shall be until we meet once more.   I die happy to think that morning and night you will hear my voice.   Oh, John, be strong, be strong, until we meet again." </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I say that I had risen in order to announce my presence, but I  could not do so while the voice was sounding.  I could only remain  half lying, half sitting, paralysed, astounded, listening to those  yearning distant musical words.  And he - he was so absorbed that  even if I had spoken he might not have heard me.  But with the  silence of the voice came my half articulated apologies and  explanations.  He sprang across the room, switched on the electric  light, and in its white glare I saw him, his eyes gleaming  with anger, his face twisted with passion, as the hapless  charwoman may have seen him weeks before. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Mr. Colmore!" he cried.  "You here!  What is the meaning of  this, sir?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        With halting words I explained it all, my neuralgia, the  narcotic, my luckless sleep and singular awakening.  As he listened  the glow of anger faded from his face, and the sad, impassive mask  closed once more over his features. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "My secret is yours, Mr. Colmore," said he.  "I have only  myself to blame for relaxing my precautions.  Half confidences are  worse than no confidences, and so you may know all since you know  so much.  The story may go where you will when I have passed away,  but until then I rely upon your sense of honour that no human soul  shall hear it from your lips.  I am proud still - God help me! - or,  at least, I am proud enough to resent that pity which this story  would draw upon me.  I have smiled at envy, and disregarded hatred,  but pity is more than I can tolerate. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "You have heard the source from which the voice comes - that  voice which has, as I understand, excited so much curiosity in my  household.  I am aware of the rumours to which it has given rise.   These speculations, whether scandalous or superstitious, are such  as I can disregard and forgive.  What I should never forgive would  be a disloyal spying and eavesdropping in order to satisfy an  illicit curiosity.  But of that, Mr. Colmore, I acquit you. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "When I was a young man, sir, many years younger than you are  now, I was launched upon town without a friend or adviser, and with  a purse which brought only too many false friends and false  advisers to my side.  I drank deeply of the wine of life - if there  is a man living who has drunk more deeply he is not a man whom I  envy.  My purse suffered, my character suffered, my constitution  suffered, stimulants became a necessity to me, I was a creature  from whom my memory recoils.  And it was at that time, the time of  my blackest degradation, that God sent into my life the gentlest,  sweetest spirit that ever descended as a ministering angel from  above.  She loved me, broken as I was, loved me, and spent her life  in making a man once more of that which had degraded itself to the  level of the beasts. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "But a fell disease struck her, and she withered away before  my eyes.  In the hour of her agony it was never of herself, of  her own sufferings and her own death that she thought.  It was all  of me.  The one pang which her fate brought to her was the fear  that when her influence was removed I should revert to that which  I had been.  It was in vain that I made oath to her that no drop of  wine would ever cross my lips.  She knew only too well the hold  that the devil had upon me - she who had striven so to loosen it - and it haunted her night and day the thought that my soul might  again be within his grip. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "It was from some friend's gossip of the sick room that she  heard of this invention - this phonograph - and with the quick  insight of a loving woman she saw how she might use it for her  ends.  She sent me to London to procure the best which money could  buy.  With her dying breath she gasped into it the words which have  held me straight ever since.  Lonely and broken, what else have I  in all the world to uphold me?  But it is enough.  Please God, I  shall face her without shame when He is pleased to reunite us!   That is my secret, Mr. Colmore, and whilst I live I leave it in  your keeping."</div>
