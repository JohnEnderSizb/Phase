<div class="story_text" id="1"><p>In the fading light of a close dull autumn afternoon Martin Stoner plodded  his way along muddy lanes and rut-seamed cart tracks that led he knew not  exactly whither. Somewhere in front of him, he fancied, lay the sea, and towards  the sea his footsteps seemed persistently turning; why he was struggling wearily  forward to that goal he could scarcely have explained, unless he was possessed  by the same instinct that turns a hard-pressed stag cliffward in its last  extremity. In his case the hounds of Fate were certainly pressing him with  unrelenting insistence; hunger, fatigue, and despairing hopelessness had numbed  his brain, and he could scarcely summon sufficient energy to wonder what  underlying impulse was driving him onward. Stoner was one of those unfortunate  individuals who seem to have tried everything; a natural slothfulness and  improvidence had always intervened to blight any chance of even moderate  success, and now he was at the end of his tether, and there was nothing more to  try. Desperation had not awakened in him any dormant reserve of energy; on the  contrary, a mental torpor grew up round the crisis of his fortunes. With the  clothes he stood up in, a halfpenny in his pocket, and no single friend or  acquaintance to turn to, with no prospect either of a bed for the night or a  meal for the morrow, Martin Stoner trudged stolidly forward, between moist  hedgerows and beneath dripping trees, his mind almost a blank, except that he  was subconsciously aware that somewhere in front of him lay the sea. Another  consciousness obtruded itself now and then - the knowledge that he was miserably  hungry. Presently he came to a halt by an open gateway that led into a spacious  and rather neglected farm-garden; there was little sign of life about, and the  farm-house at the further end of the garden looked chill and inhospitable. A  drizzling rain, however, was setting in, and Stoner thought that here perhaps he  might obtain a few minutes' shelter and buy a glass of milk with his last  remaining coin. He turned slowly and wearily into the garden and followed a  narrow, flagged path up to a side door. Before he had time to knock the door  opened and a bent, withered-looking old man stood aside in the doorway as though  to let him pass in. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Could I come in out of the rain?" Stoner began, but the old man  interrupted him. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Come in, Master Tom. I knew you would come back one of these days." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Stoner lurched across the threshold and stood staring uncomprehendingly at  the other. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Sit down while I put you out a bit of supper," said the old man with  quavering eagerness. Stoner's legs gave way from very weariness, and he sank  inertly into the arm-chair that had been pushed up to him. In another minute he  was devouring the cold meat, cheese, and bread, that had been placed on the  table at his side. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "You'm little changed these four years," went on the old man, in a voice  that sounded to Stoner as something in a dream, far away and inconsequent; "but  you'll find us a deal changed, you will. There's no one about the place same as  when you left; nought but me and your old Aunt. I'll go and tell her that you'm  come; she won't be seeing you, but she'll let you stay right enough. She always  did say if you was to come back you should stay, but she'd never set eyes on you  or speak to you again." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The old man placed a mug of beer on the table in front of Stoner and then  hobbled away down a long passage. The drizzle of rain had changed to a furious  lashing downpour, which beat violently against door and windows. The wanderer  thought with a shudder of what the sea-shore must look like under this drenching  rainfall, with night beating down on all sides. He finished the food and beer  and sat numbly waiting for the return of his strange host. As the minutes ticked  by on the grandfather clock in the corner a new hope began to flicker and grow  in the young man's mind; it was merely the expansion of his former craving for  food and a few minutes' rest into a longing to find a night's shelter under this  seemingly hospitable roof. A clattering of footsteps down the passage heralded  the old farm servant's return. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The old Missus won't see you, Master Tom, but she says you are to stay.  'Tis right enough, seeing the farm will be yours when she be put under earth.  I've had a fire lit in your room, Master Tom, and the maids has put fresh sheets  on to the bed. You'll find nought changed up there. Maybe you'm tired and would  like to go there now." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Without a word Martin Stoner rose heavily to his feet and followed his  ministering angel along a passage, up a short creaking stair, along another  passage, and into a large room lit with a cheerfully blazing fire. There was but  little furniture, plain, old-fashioned, and good of its kind; a stuffed squirrel  in a case and a wall-calendar of four years ago were about the only symptoms of  decoration. But Stoner had eyes for little else than the bed, and could scarce  wait to tear his clothes off him before rolling in a luxury of weariness into  its comfortable depths. The hounds of Fate seemed to have checked for a brief  moment. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        In the cold light of morning Stoner laughed mirthlessly as he slowly realized  the position in which he found himself. Perhaps he might snatch a bit of  breakfast on the strength of his likeness to this other missing neer-do-well,  and get safely away before any one discovered the fraud that had been thrust on  him. In the room downstairs he found the bent old man ready with a dish of bacon  and fried eggs for "Master Tom's" breakfast, while a hard-faced elderly maid  brought in a teapot and poured him out a cup of tea. As he sat at the table a  small spaniel came up and made friendly advances. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "'Tis old Bowker's pup," explained the old man, whom the hard-faced maid  had addressed as George. "She was main fond of you; never seemed the same after  you went away to Australee. She died 'bout a year agone. 'Tis her pup." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Stoner found it difficult to regret her decease; as a witness for  identification she would have left something to be desired. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "You'll go for a ride, Master Tom?" was the next startling proposition that  came from the old man. "We've a nice little roan cob that goes well in saddle.  Old Biddy is getting a bit up in years, though 'er goes well still, but I'll  have the little roan saddled and brought round to door." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I've got no riding things," stammered the castaway, almost laughing as he  looked down at his one suit of well-worn clothes. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Master Tom," said the old man earnestly, almost with an offended air,  "all your things is just as you left them. A bit of airing before the fire an'  they'll be all right. 'Twill be a bit of a distraction like, a little riding and  wild-fowling now and agen. You'll find the folk around here has hard and bitter  minds towards you. They hasn't forgotten nor forgiven. No one'll come nigh you,  so you'd best get what distraction you can with horse and dog. They'm good  company, too." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Old George hobbled away to give his orders, and Stoner, feeling more than  ever like one in a dream, went upstairs to inspect "Master Tom's" wardrobe. A  ride was one of the pleasures dearest to his heart, and there was some  protection against immediate discovery of his imposture in the thought that none  of Tom's aforetime companions were likely to favour him with a close inspection.  As the interloper thrust himself into some tolerably well-fitting riding cords  he wondered vaguely what manner of misdeed the genuine Tom had committed to set  the whole countryside against him. The thud of quick, eager hoofs on damp earth  cut short his speculations. The roan cob had been brought up to the side door. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Talk of beggars on horseback," thought Stoner to himself, as he trotted  rapidly along the muddy lanes where he had tramped yesterday as a down-at-heel  outcast; and then he flung reflection indolently aside and gave himself up to  the pleasure of a smart canter along the turf-grown side of a level stretch of  road. At an open gateway he checked his pace to allow two carts to turn into a  field. The lads driving the carts found time to give him a prolonged stare, and  as he passed on he heard an excited voice call out, "'Tis Tom Prike! I knowed  him at once; showing himself here agen, is he?" </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Evidently the likeness which had imposed at close quarters on a doddering old  man was good enough to mislead younger eyes at a short distance. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        In the course of his ride he met with ample evidence to confirm the statement  that local folk had neither forgotten nor forgiven the bygone crime which had  come to him as a legacy from the absent Tom. Scowling looks, mutterings, and  nudgings greeted him whenever he chanced upon human beings; "Bowker's pup,"  trotting placidly by his side, seemed the one element of friendliness in a  hostile world. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        As he dismounted at the side door he caught a fleeting glimpse of a gaunt,  elderly woman peering at him from behind the curtain of an upper window.  Evidently this was his aunt by adoption. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Over the ample midday meal that stood in readiness for him Stoner was able to  review the possibilities of his extraordinary situation. The real Tom, after  four years of absence, might suddenly turn up at the farm, or a letter might  come from him at any moment. Again, in the character of heir to the farm, the  false Tom might be called on to sign documents, which would be an embarrassing  predicament. Or a relative might arrive who would not imitate the aunt's  attitude of aloofness. All these things would mean ignominious exposure. On the  other hand, the alternatives was the open sky and the muddy lanes that led down  to the sea. The farm offered him, at any rate, a temporary refuge from  destitution; farming was one of the many things he had "tried," and he would  be able to do a certain amount of work in return for the hospitality to which he  was so little entitled. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Will you have cold pork for your supper," asked the hard-faced maid, as  she cleared the table, "or will you have it hotted up?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Hot, with onions," said Stoner. It was the only time in his life that he  had made a rapid decision. And as he gave the order he knew that he meant to  stay. </p></div>

			<div class="pagers" id="6"><a href="HouFat.shtml.html#5"><b>&lt;</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="HouFat.shtml.html#6">6</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="HouFat.shtml.html#7"><b>&gt;</b></a></div>
			
			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Stoner kept rigidly to those portions of the house which seemed to have been  allotted to him by a tacit treaty of delimitation. When he took part in the  farm-work it was as one who worked under orders and never initiated them. Old  George, the roan cob, and Bowker's pup were his sole companions in a world that  was otherwise frostily silent and hostile. Of the mistress of the farm he saw  nothing. Once, when he knew she had gone forth to church, he made a furtive  visit to the farm parlour in an endeavour to glean some fragmentary knowledge of  the young man whose place he had usurped, and whose ill-repute he had fastened  on himself. There were many photographs hung on the walls, or stuck in prim  frames, but the likeness he sought for was not among them. At last, in an album  thrust out of sight, he came across what he wanted. There was a whole series,  labelled "Tom," a podgy child of three, in a fantastic frock, an awkward boy  of about twelve, holding a cricket bat as though be loathed it, a rather  good-looking youth of eighteen with very smooth, evenly parted hair, and,  finally, a young man with a somewhat surly dare-devil expression. At this last  portrait Stoner looked with particular interest; the likeness to himself was  unmistakable. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        From the lips of old George, who was garrulous enough on most subjects, he  tried again and again to learn something of the nature of the offence which shut  him off as a creature to be shunned and hated by hiss fellow-men. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "What do the folk around here say about me?" he asked one day as they were  walking home from an outlying field. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The old man shook his head. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "They be bitter agen you, mortal bitter. Ay, 'tis a sad business, a sad  business." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And never could he be got to say anything more enlightening. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        On a clear frosty evening, a few days before the festival of Christmas,  Stoner stood in a corner of the orchard which commanded a wide view of the  countryside. Here and there he could see the twinkling dots of lamp or candle  glow which told of human homes where the goodwill and jollity of the season held  their sway. Behind him lay the grim, silent farm-house, where no one ever  laughed, where even a quarrel would have seemed cheerful. As he turned to look  at the long grey front of the gloom-shadowed building, a door opened and old  George came hurriedly forth. Stoner heard his adopted name called in a tone of  strained anxiety. Instantly be knew that something untoward had happened, and  with a quick revulsion of outlook his sanctuary became in his eyes a place of  peace and contentment, from which he dreaded to be driven. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Master Tom," said the old man in a hoarse whisper, "you must slip away  quiet from here for a few days. Michael Ley is back in the village, an' he  swears to shoot you if he can come across you. He'll do it, too, there's murder  in the look of him. Get away under cover of night, 'tis only for a week or so,  he won't be here longer." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "But where am I to go?" stammered Stoner, who had caught the infection of  the old man's obvious terror. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Go right away along the coast to Punchford and keep hid there. When  Michael's safe gone I'll ride the roan over to the Green Dragon at Punchford;  when you see the cob stabled at the Green Dragon 'tis a sign you may come back  agen." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "But--" began Stoner hesitatingly. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "'Tis all right for money," said the other; "the old Missus agrees you'd  best do as I say, and she's given me this." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The old man produced three sovereigns and some odd silver. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Stoner felt more of a cheat than ever as he stole away that night from the  back gate of the farm with the old woman's money in his pocket. Old George and  Bowker's pup stood watching him a silent farewell from the yard. He could  scarcely fancy that he would ever come back, and he felt a throb of compunction  for those two humble friends who would wait wistfully for his return. Some day  perhaps the real Tom would come back, and there would be wild wonderment among  those simple farm folks as to the identity of the shadowy guest they had  harboured under their roof. For his own fate he felt no immediate anxiety; three  pounds goes but little way in the world when there is nothing behind it, but to  a man who has counted his exchequer in pennies it seems a good starting-point.  Fortune had done him a whimsically kind turn when last he trod these lanes as a  hopeless adventurer, and there might yet be a chance of his finding some work  and making a fresh start; as he got further from the farm his spirits rose  higher. There was a sense of relief in regaining once more his lost identity and  ceasing to be the uneasy ghost of another. He scarcely bothered to speculate  about the implacable enemy who had dropped from nowhere into his life; since  that life was now behind him one unreal item the more made little difference.  For the first time for many months he began to hum a careless light-hearted  refrain. Then there stepped out from the shadow of an overhanging oak tree a man  with a gun. There was no need to wonder who he might be; the moonlight falling  on his white set face revealed a glare of human hate such as Stoner in the ups  and downs of his wanderings had never seen before. He sprang aside in a wild  effort to break through the hedge that bordered the lane, but the tough branches  held him fast. The hounds of Fate had waited for him in those narrow lanes, and  this time they were not to be denied.</div>
