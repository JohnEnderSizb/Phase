<div class="story_text" id="1"><p>A man stood upon a railroad bridge in northern Alabama,  looking down into the swift water twenty feet below.  The  man's hands were behind his back, the wrists bound with a  cord.  A rope closely encircled his neck.  It was attached to  a stout cross-timber above his head and the slack feel to the  level of his knees.  Some loose boards laid upon the ties  supporting the rails of the railway supplied a footing for  him and his executioners - two private soldiers of the  Federal army, directed by a sergeant who in civil life may  have been a deputy sheriff.  At a short remove upon the same  temporary platform was an officer in the uniform of his rank,  armed.  He was a captain.  A sentinel at each end of the  bridge stood with his rifle in the position known as  "support," that is to say, vertical in front of the left  shoulder, the hammer resting on the forearm thrown straight  across the chest - a formal and unnatural position,  enforcing an erect carriage of the body.  It did not appear  to be the duty of these two men to know what was occurring at  the center of the bridge; they merely blockaded the two ends  of the foot planking that traversed it. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Beyond one of the sentinels nobody was in sight; the railroad  ran straight away into a forest for a hundred yards, then,  curving, was lost to view.  Doubtless there was an outpost  farther along.  The other bank of the stream was open ground  - a gentle slope topped with a stockade of vertical tree  trunks, loopholed for rifles, with a single embrasure  through which protruded the muzzle of a brass cannon  commanding the bridge.  Midway up the slope between the  bridge and fort were the spectators - a single company of  infantry in line, at 'parade rest,' the butts of their rifles  on the ground, the barrels inclining slightly backward  against the right shoulder, the hands crossed upon the stock.  A lieutenant stood at the right of the line, the point  of his sword upon the ground, his left hand resting upon his  right.  Excepting the group of four at the center of the  bridge, not a man moved.  The company faced the bridge,  staring stonily, motionless.  The sentinels, facing the  banks of the stream, might have been statues to adorn the  bridge.  The captain stood with folded arms, silent,  observing the work of his subordinates, but making no sign.   Death is a dignitary who when he comes announced is to be  received with formal manifestations of respect, even by those  most familiar with him.  In the code of military etiquette  silence and fixity are forms of deference. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The man who was engaged in being hanged was apparently about  thirty-five years of age.  He was a civilian, if one might  judge from his habit, which was that of a planter.  His  features were good - a straight nose, firm mouth, broad  forehead, from which his long, dark hair was combed straight  back, falling behind his ears to the collar of his well  fitting frock coat.  He wore a moustache and pointed beard,  but no whiskers; his eyes were large and dark gray, and had a  kindly expression which one would hardly have expected in one  whose neck was in the hemp.  Evidently this was no vulgar  assassin.  The liberal military code makes provision for  hanging many kinds of persons, and gentlemen are not  excluded. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The preparations being complete, the two private soldiers  stepped aside and each drew away the plank upon which he had  been standing.  The sergeant turned to the captain, saluted  and placed himself immediately behind that officer, who in  turn moved apart one pace.  These movements left the  condemned man and the sergeant standing on the two ends of  the same plank, which spanned three of the cross-ties of the  bridge.  The end upon which the civilian stood almost, but  not quite, reached a fourth.  This plank had been held in  place by the weight of the captain; it was now held by that  of the sergeant.  At a signal from the former the latter  would step aside, the plank would tilt and the condemned man  go down between two ties.  The arrangement commended itself  to his judgement as simple and effective.  His face had not  been covered nor his eyes bandaged.  He looked a moment at  his 'unsteadfast footing,' then let his gaze wander to the  swirling water of the stream racing madly beneath his feet.   A piece of dancing driftwood caught his attention and his  eyes followed it down the current.  How slowly it appeared  to move!  What a sluggish stream! </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He closed his eyes in order to fix his last thoughts upon his  wife and children.  The water, touched to gold by the early  sun, the brooding mists under the banks at some distance down  the stream, the fort, the soldiers, the piece of drift - all  had distracted him.  And now he became conscious of a new  disturbance.  Striking through the thought of his dear  ones was sound which he could neither ignore nor understand,  a sharp, distinct, metallic percussion like the stroke of a  blacksmith's hammer upon the anvil; it had the same ringing  quality.  He wondered what it was, and whether immeasurably  distant or near by - it seemed both.  Its recurrence was  regular, but as slow as the tolling of a death knell.  He  awaited each new stroke with impatience and - he knew not  why - apprehension.  The intervals of silence grew  progressively longer; the delays became maddening.  With  their greater infrequency the sounds increased in strength  and sharpness.  They hurt his ear like the trust of a knife;  he feared he would shriek.  What he heard was the ticking of  his watch. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He unclosed his eyes and saw again the water below him.  "If  I could free my hands," he thought, "I might throw off the  noose and spring into the stream.  By diving I could evade  the bullets and, swimming vigorously, reach the bank, take  to the woods and get away home.  My home, thank God, is as  yet outside their lines; my wife and little ones are still  beyond the invader's farthest advance." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        As these thoughts, which have here to be set down in words,  were flashed into the doomed man's brain rather than evolved  from it the captain nodded to the sergeant.  The sergeant  stepped aside. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class='section_break'>II</p><p>Peyton Fahrquhar was a well to do planter, of an old and  highly respected Alabama family.  Being a slave owner and  like other slave owners a politician, he was naturally an  original secessionist and ardently devoted to the Southern  cause.  Circumstances of an imperious nature, which it is  unnecessary to relate here, had prevented him from taking  service with that gallant army which had fought the  disastrous campaigns ending with the fall of Corinth, and he  chafed under the inglorious restraint, longing for the  release of his energies, the larger life of the soldier, the  opportunity for distinction.  That opportunity, he felt,  would come, as it comes to all in wartime.  Meanwhile he  did what he could.  No service was too humble for him to  perform in the aid of the South, no adventure to perilous for  him to undertake if consistent with the character of a  civilian who was at heart a soldier, and who in good faith  and without too much qualification assented to at least a  part of the frankly villainous dictum that all is fair in  love and war. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        One evening while Fahrquhar and his wife were sitting on a  rustic bench near the entrance to his grounds, a gray-clad  soldier rode up to the gate and asked for a drink of water.   Mrs. Fahrquhar was only too happy to serve him with her own  white hands.  While she was fetching the water her husband  approached the dusty horseman and inquired eagerly for news  from the front. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The Yanks are repairing the railroads," said the man, "and  are getting ready for another advance.  They have reached the  Owl Creek bridge, put it in order and built a stockade on the  north bank.  The commandant has issued an order, which is  posted everywhere, declaring that any civilian caught  interfering with the railroad, its bridges, tunnels, or  trains will be summarily hanged.  I saw the order." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "How far is it to the Owl Creek bridge?" Fahrquhar asked. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "About thirty miles." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Is there no force on this side of the creek?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Only a picket post half a mile out, on the railroad, and a  single sentinel at this end of the bridge." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Suppose a man - a civilian and student of hanging -  should elude the picket post and perhaps get the better of  the sentinel," said Fahrquhar, smiling, "what could he  accomplish?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The soldier reflected.  "I was there a month ago," he  replied.  "I observed that the flood of last winter had  lodged a great quantity of driftwood against the wooden pier  at this end of the bridge.  It is now dry and would burn like  tinder." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The lady had now brought the water, which the soldier drank.   He thanked her ceremoniously, bowed to her husband and rode  away.  An hour later, after nightfall, he repassed the  plantation, going northward in the direction from which he  had come.  He was a Federal scout. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p class='section_break'>III</p>As Peyton Fahrquhar fell straight downward through the  bridge he lost consciousness and was as one already dead.   From this state he was awakened - ages later, it seemed to  him - by the pain of a sharp pressure upon his throat,  followed by a sense of suffocation.  Keen, poignant agonies  seemed to shoot from his neck downward through every fiber of  his body and limbs.  These pains appeared to flash along well  defined lines of ramification and to beat with an  inconceivably rapid periodicity.  They seemed like streams of  pulsating fire heating him to an intolerable temperature.  As  to his head, he was conscious of nothing but a feeling of  fullness - of congestion.  These sensations were  unaccompanied by thought.  The intellectual part of his  nature was already effaced; he had power only to feel, and  feeling was torment.  He was conscious of motion.   Encompassed in a luminous cloud, of which he was now merely  the fiery heart, without material substance, he swung  through unthinkable arcs of oscillation, like a vast  pendulum.  Then all at once, with terrible suddenness, the  light about him shot upward with the noise of a loud splash;  a frightful roaring was in his ears, and all was cold and  dark.  The power of thought was restored; he knew that the  rope had broken and he had fallen into the stream.  There was  no additional strangulation; the noose about his neck  was already suffocating him and kept the water from his  lungs.  To die of hanging at the bottom of a river! - the  idea seemed to him ludicrous.  He opened his eyes in the  darkness and saw above him a gleam of light, but how distant,  how inaccessible!  He was still sinking, for the light became  fainter and fainter until it was a mere glimmer.  Then it  began to grow and brighten, and he knew that he was rising  toward the surface - knew it with reluctance, for he was now  very comfortable.  "To be hanged and drowned," he thought,  "that is not so bad; but I do not wish to be shot.  No; I  will not be shot; that is not fair." </p></div>

			<div class="pagers" id="6"><a href="OccOwl.shtml.html#5"><b>&lt;</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="OccOwl.shtml.html#6">6</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="OccOwl.shtml.html#7"><b>&gt;</b></a></div>
			
			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He was not conscious of an effort, but a sharp pain in his  wrist apprised him that he was trying to free his hands.  He  gave the struggle his attention, as an idler might observe  the feat of a juggler, without interest in the outcome.  What  splendid effort! - what magnificent, what superhuman  strength!  Ah, that was a fine endeavor!  Bravo!  The cord  fell away; his arms parted and floated upward, the hands  dimly seen on each side in the growing light.  He watched  them with a new interest as first one and then the other  pounced upon the noose at his neck.  They tore it away and  thrust it fiercely aside, its undulations resembling those of  a water snake.  "Put it back, put it back!"  He thought he  shouted these words to his hands, for the undoing of the  noose had been succeeded by the direst pang that he had yet  experienced.  His neck ached horribly; his brain was on fire,  his heart, which had been fluttering faintly, gave a great  leap, trying to force itself out at his mouth.  His whole  body was racked and wrenched with an insupportable anguish!   But his disobedient hands gave no heed to the command.  They  beat the water vigorously with quick, downward strokes,  forcing him to the surface.  He felt his head emerge; his  eyes were blinded by the sunlight; his chest expanded  convulsively, and with a supreme and crowning agony his lungs  engulfed a great draught of air, which instantly he expelled  in a shriek! </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He was now in full possession of his physical senses.  They  were, indeed, preternaturally keen and alert.  Something in  the awful disturbance of his organic system had so exalted  and refined them that they made record of things never before  perceived.  He felt the ripples upon his face and heard their  separate sounds as they struck.  He looked at the forest on  the bank of the stream, saw the individual trees, the leaves  and the veining of each leaf - he saw the very insects upon  them:  the locusts, the brilliant bodied flies, the gray  spiders stretching their webs from twig to twig.  He noted  the prismatic colors in all the dewdrops upon a million  blades of grass.  The humming of the gnats that danced above  the eddies of the stream, the beating of the dragon flies'  wings, the strokes of the water spiders' legs, like oars  which had lifted their boat - all these made audible  music.  A fish slid along beneath his eyes and he heard the  rush of its body parting the water. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He had come to the surface facing down the stream; in a  moment the visible world seemed to wheel slowly round,  himself the pivotal point, and he saw the bridge, the fort,  the soldiers upon the bridge, the captain, the sergeant, the  two privates, his executioners.  They were in silhouette  against the blue sky.  They shouted and gesticulated,  pointing at him.  The captain had drawn his pistol, but did  not fire; the others were unarmed.  Their movements were  grotesque and horrible, their forms gigantic. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Suddenly he heard a sharp report and something struck the  water smartly within a few inches of his head, spattering his  face with spray.  He heard a second report, and saw one of  the sentinels with his rifle at his shoulder, a light cloud  of blue smoke rising from the muzzle.  The man in the water  saw the eye of the man on the bridge gazing into his own  through the sights of the rifle.  He observed that it was a  gray eye and remembered having read that gray eyes were  keenest, and that all famous marksmen had them.   Nevertheless, this one had missed. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        A counter-swirl had caught Fahrquhar and turned him half  round; he was again looking at the forest on the bank  opposite the fort.  The sound of a clear, high voice in a  monotonous singsong now rang out behind him and came across  the water with a distinctness that pierced and subdued all  other sounds, even the beating of the ripples in his ears.   Although no soldier, he had frequented camps enough to know  the dread significance of that deliberate, drawling,  aspirated chant; the lieutenant on shore was taking a part in  the morning's work.  How coldly and pitilessly - with what  an even, calm intonation, presaging, and enforcing  tranquillity in the men - with what accurately measured  interval fell those cruel words: </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Company! . . . Attention!  . . . Shoulder arms! . . . Ready!  . . . Aim!  . . . Fire!" </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Fahrquhar dived - dived as deeply as he could.  The water  roared in his ears like the voice of Niagara, yet he heard  the dull thunder of the volley and, rising again toward the  surface, met shining bits of metal, singularly flattened,  oscillating slowly downward.  Some of them touched him on the  face and hands, then fell away, continuing their descent.   One lodged between his collar and neck; it was uncomfortably  warm and he snatched it out. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        As he rose to the surface, gasping for breath, he saw that he  had been a long time under water; he was perceptibly farther  downstream - nearer to safety.  The soldiers had almost  finished reloading; the metal ramrods flashed all at once in  the sunshine as they were drawn from the barrels,  turned in the air, and thrust into their sockets.  The two  sentinels fired again, independently and ineffectually. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The hunted man saw all this over his shoulder; he was now  swimming vigorously with the current.  His brain was as  energetic as his arms and legs; he thought with the rapidity  of lightning: </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The officer," he reasoned, "will not make that martinet's  error a second time.  It is as easy to dodge a volley as a  single shot.  He has probably already given the command to  fire at will.  God help me, I cannot dodge them all!" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        An appalling splash within two yards of him was followed by a  loud, rushing sound, <I>diminuendo</I>, which seemed to travel back  through the air to the fort and died in an explosion which  stirred the very river to its deeps!  A rising sheet of water  curved over him, fell down upon him, blinded him, strangled  him!  The cannon had taken an hand in the game.  As he shook  his head free from the commotion of the smitten water he  heard the deflected shot humming through the air ahead, and  in an instant it was cracking and smashing the branches in  the forest beyond. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "They will not do that again," he thought; "the next time  they will use a charge of grape.  I must keep my eye upon  the gun; the smoke will apprise me - the report arrives too  late; it lags behind the missile.  That is a good gun." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Suddenly he felt himself whirled round and round - spinning  like a top.  The water, the banks, the forests, the now  distant bridge, fort and men, all were commingled and  blurred.  Objects were represented by their colors only;  circular horizontal streaks of color - that was all he saw.   He had been caught in a vortex and was being whirled on with  a velocity of advance and gyration that made him giddy and  sick.  In few moments he was flung upon the gravel at the  foot of the left bank of the stream - the southern bank -  and behind a projecting point which concealed him from his  enemies.  The sudden arrest of his motion, the abrasion of  one of his hands on the gravel, restored him, and he wept  with delight.  He dug his fingers into the sand, threw it  over himself in handfuls and audibly blessed it.  It looked  like diamonds, rubies, emeralds; he could think of nothing  beautiful which it did not resemble.  The trees upon the bank  were giant garden plants; he noted a definite order in their  arrangement, inhaled the fragrance of their blooms.  A  strange roseate light shone through the spaces among their  trunks and the wind made in their branches the music of  Aeolian harps.  He had not wish to perfect his escape - he  was content to remain in that enchanting spot until retaken. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        A whiz and a rattle of grapeshot among the branches high  above his head roused him from his dream.  The baffled  cannoneer had fired him a random farewell.  He sprang  to his feet, rushed up the sloping bank, and plunged into the  forest. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        All that day he travelled, laying his course by the rounding  sun.  The forest seemed interminable; nowhere did he  discover a break in it, not even a woodman's road.  He had  not known that he lived in so wild a region.  There was  something uncanny in the revelation. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        By nightfall he was fatigued, footsore, famished.  The  thought of his wife and children urged him on.  At last he  found a road which led him in what he knew to be the right  direction.  It was as wide and straight as a city street, yet  it seemed untravelled.  No fields bordered it, no dwelling  anywhere.  Not so much as the barking of a dog suggested  human habitation.  The black bodies of the trees formed a  straight wall on both sides, terminating on the horizon in a  point, like a diagram in a lesson in perspective.  Overhead,  as he looked up through this rift in the wood, shone great  golden stars looking unfamiliar and grouped in strange  constellations.  He was sure they were arranged in some order  which had a secret and malign significance.  The wood on  either side was full of singular noises, among which - once,  twice, and again - he distinctly heard whispers in an  unknown tongue. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        His neck was in pain and lifting his hand to it found it  horribly swollen.  He knew that it had a circle of black  where the rope had bruised it.  His eyes felt congested; he  could no longer close them.  His tongue was swollen with  thirst; he relieved its fever by thrusting it forward from  between his teeth into the cold air.  How softly the turf had  carpeted the untravelled avenue - he could no longer feel the  roadway beneath his feet! </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Doubtless, despite his suffering, he had fallen asleep while  walking, for now he sees another scene - perhaps he has  merely recovered from a delirium.  He stands at the gate of  his own home.  All is as he left it, and all bright and  beautiful in the morning sunshine.  He must have travelled the  entire night.  As he pushes open the gate and passes up the  wide white walk, he sees a flutter of female garments; his  wife, looking fresh and cool and sweet, steps down from the  veranda to meet him.  At the bottom of the steps she stands  waiting, with a smile of ineffable joy, an attitude of  matchless grace and dignity.  Ah, how beautiful she is!  He  springs forwards with extended arms.  As he is about to clasp  her he feels a stunning blow upon the back of the neck; a  blinding white light blazes all about him with a sound like  the shock of a cannon - then all is darkness and silence! </p></div>
