<div class="story_text" id="1"><p>"Tell me a story," said the Baroness, staring out despairingly at the rain;  it was that light, apologetic sort of rain that looks as if it was going to  leave off every minute and goes on for the greater part of the afternoon. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "What sort of story?" asked Clovis, giving his croquet mallet a valedictory  shove into retirement. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "One just true enough to be interesting and not true enough to be  tiresome," said the Baroness. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Clovis rearranged several cushions to his personal solace and satisfaction;  he knew that the Baroness liked her guests to be comfortable, and he thought it  right to respect her wishes in that particular. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Have I ever told you the story of St. Vespaluus?" he asked. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "You've told me stories about grand-dukes and lion-tamers and financiers'  widows and a postmaster in Herzegovina," said the Baroness, "and about an  Italian jockey and an amateur governess who went to Warsaw, and several about  your mother, but certainly never anything about a saint." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "This story happened a long while ago," he said, "in those uncomfortable  piebald times when a third of the people were Pagan, and a third Christian, and  the biggest third of all just followed whichever religion the Court happened to  profess. There was a certain king called Hkrikros, who had a fearful temper and  no immediate successor in his own family; his married sister, however, had  provided him with a large stock of nephews from which to select his heir. And  the most eligible and royally-approved of all these nephews was the  sixteen-year-old Vespaluus. He was the best looking, and the best horseman and  javelin-thrower, and had that priceless princely gift of being able to walk past  a supplicant with an air of not having seen him, but would certainly have given  something if he had. My mother has that gift to a certain extent; she can go  smilingly and financially unscathed through a charity bazaar, and meet the  organizers next day with a solicitous 'had I but known you were in need of  funds' air that is really rather a triumph in audacity. Now Hkrikros was a Pagan  of the first water, and kept the worship of the sacred serpents, who lived in a  hallowed grove on a hill near the royal palace, up to a high pitch of  enthusiasm. The common people were allowed to please themselves, within certain  discreet limits, in the matter of private religion, but any official in the  service of the Court who went over to the new cult was looked down on, literally  as well as metaphorically, the looking down being done from the gallery that ran  round the royal bear-pit. Consequently there was considerable scandal and  consternation when the youthful Vespaluus appeared one day at a Court function  with a rosary tucked into his belt, and announced in reply to angry questionings  that he had decided to adopt Christianity, or at any rate to give it a trial. If  it had been any of the other nephews the king would possibly have ordered  something drastic in the way of scourging and banishment, but in the case of the  favoured Vespaluus he determined to look on the whole thing much as a modern  father might regard the announced intention of his son to adopt the stage as a  profession. He sent accordingly for the Royal Librarian. The royal library in  those days was not a very extensive affair, and the keeper of the king's books  had a great deal of leisure on his hands. Consequently he was in frequent demand  for the settlement of other people's affairs when these strayed beyond normal  limits and got temporarily unmanageable. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        " 'You must reason with Prince Vespaluus,' said the king, 'and impress on  him the error of his ways. We cannot have the heir to the throne setting such a  dangerous example.' </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        " 'But where shall I find the necessary arguments?' asked the Librarian. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        " 'I give you free leave to pick and choose your arguments in the royal  woods and coppices,' said the king; 'if you cannot get together some cutting  observations and stinging retorts suitable to the occasion you are a person of  very poor resource.' </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "So the Librarian went into the woods and gathered a goodly selection of  highly argumentative rods and switches, and then proceeded to reason with  Vespaluus on the folly and iniquity and above all the unseemliness of his  conduct. His reasoning left a deep impression on the young prince, an impression  which lasted for many weeks, during which time nothing more was heard about the  unfortunate lapse into Christianity. Then a further scandal of the same nature  agitated the Court. At a time when he should have been engaged in audibly  invoking the gracious protection and patronage of the holy serpents, Vespaluus  was heard singing a chant in honour of St. Odilo of Cluny. The king was furious  at this new outbreak, and began to take a gloomy view of the situation;  Vespaluus was evidently going to show a dangerous obstinacy in persisting in his  heresy. And yet there was nothing in his appearance to justify such  perverseness; he had not the pale eye of the fanatic or the mystic look of the  dreamer. On the contrary, he was quite the best-looking boy at Court; he had an  elegant, well-knit figure, a healthy complexion, eyes the colour of very ripe  mulberries, and dark hair, smooth and very well cared for." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "It sounds like a description of what you imagine yourself to have been like  at the age of sixteen," said the Baroness. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "My mother has probably been showing you some of my early photographs,"  said Clovis. Having turned the sarcasm into a compliment, he resumed his story. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The king had Vespaluus shut up in a dark tower for three days, with nothing  but bread and water to live on, the squealing and fluttering of bats to listen  to, and drifting clouds to watch through one little window slit. The anti-Pagan  section of the community began to talk portentously of the boy-martyr. The  martyrdom was mitigated, as far as the food was concerned, by the carelessness  of the tower warden, who once or twice left a portion of his own supper of  broiled meat and fruit and wine by mistake in the prince's cell. After the  punishment was over, Vespaluus was closely watched for any further symptom of  religious perversity, for the king was determined to stand no more opposition on  so important a matter, even from a favourite nephew. If there was any more of  this nonsense, he said, the succession to the throne would have to be altered. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "For a time all went well; the festival of summer sports was approaching,  and the young Vespaluus was too engrossed in wrestling and foot-running and  javelin-throwing competitions to bother himself with the strife of conflicting  religious systems. Then, however, came the great culminating feature of the  summer festival, the ceremonial dance round the grove of the sacred serpents,  and Vespaluus, as we should say, 'sat it out.' The affront to the State religion  was too public and ostentatious to be overlooked, even if the king had been so  minded, and he was not in the least so minded. For a day and a half he sat apart  and brooded, and every one thought he was debating within himself the question  of the young prince's death or pardon; as a matter of fact he was merely  thinking out the manner of the boys death. As the thing had to be done, and was  bound to attract an enormous amount of public attention in any case, it was as  well to make it as spectacular and impressive as possible. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        " 'Apart from his unfortunate taste in religions,' said the king, 'and his  obstinacy in adhering to it, he is a sweet and pleasant youth, therefore it is  meet and fitting that he should be done to death by the winged envoys of  sweetness.' </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        " 'Your Majesty means--?' said the Royal Librarian. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        " 'I mean,' said the king, 'that he shall be stung to death by bees. By the  royal bees, of course.' </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        " 'A most elegant death,' said the Librarian. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        " 'Elegant and spectacular, and decidedly painful,' said the king; 'it  fulfills all the conditions that could be wished for.' </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The king himself thought out all the details of the execution ceremony.  Vespaluus was to be stripped of his clothes, his hands were to be bound behind  him, and he was then to be slung in a recumbent position immediately above three  of the largest of the royal beehives, so that the least movement of his body  would bring him in jarring contact with them. The rest could be safely left to  the bees. The death throes, the king computed, might last anything from fifteen  to forty minutes, though there was division of opinion and considerable wagering  among the other nephews as to whether death might not be almost instantaneous,  or, on the other hand, whether it might not be deferred for a couple of hours.  Anyway, they all agreed, it was vastly preferable to being thrown down into an  evil smelling bear-pit and being clawed and mauled to death by imperfectly  carnivorous animals. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "It so happened, however, that the keeper of the royal hives had leanings  towards Christianity himself, and moreover, like most of the Court officials, he  was very much attached to Vespaluus. On the eve of the execution, therefore, he  busied himself with removing the stings from all the royal bees; it was a long  and delicate operation, but he was an expert beemaster, and by working hard  nearly all night he succeeded in disarming all, or almost all, of the hive  inmates." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I didn't know you could take the sting from a live bee," said the Baroness  incredulously. </p></div>

			<div class="pagers" id="5"><a href="StoVes.shtml.html#4"><b>&lt;</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="StoVes.shtml.html#5">5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="StoVes.shtml.html#6"><b>&gt;</b></a></div>
			
			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Every profession has its secrets," replied Clovis; "if it hadn't it  wouldn't be a profession. Well, the moment for the execution arrived; the king  and Court took their places, and accommodation was found for as many of the  populace as wished to witness the unusual spectacle. Fortunately the royal  bee-yard was of considerable dimensions, and was commanded, moreover, by the  terraces that ran round the royal gardens; with a little squeezing and the  erection of a few platforms room was found for everybody. Vespaluus was carried  into the open space in front of the hives, blushing and slightly embarrassed,  but not at all displeased at the attention which was being centred on him." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "He seems to have resembled you in more things than in appearance," said  the Baroness. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Don't interrupt at a critical point in the story," said Clovis. "As soon  as he had been carefully adjusted in the prescribed position over the hives, and  almost before the gaolers had time to retire to a safe distance, Vespaluus gave  a lusty and well-aimed kick, which sent all three hives toppling one over  another. The next moment he was wrapped from head to foot in bees; each  individual insect nursed the dreadful and humiliating knowledge that in this  supreme hour of catastrophe it could not sting, but each felt that it ought to  pretend to. Vespaluus squealed and wriggled with laughter, for he was being  tickled nearly to death, and now and again he gave a furious kick and used a bad  word as one of the few bees that had escaped disarmament got its protest home.  But the spectators saw with amazement that he showed no signs of approaching  death agony, and as the bees dropped wearily away in clusters from his body his  flesh was seen to be as white and smooth as before the ordeal, with a shiny  glaze from the honey-smear of innumerable bee-feet, and here and there a small  red spot where one of the rare stings had left its mark. It was obvious that a  miracle had been performed in his favour, and one loud murmur, of astonishment  or exultation, rose from the onlooking crowd. The king gave orders for Vespaluus  to be taken down to await further orders, and stalked silently back to his  midday meal, at which he was careful to eat heartily and drink copiously as  though nothing unusual had happened. After dinner he sent for the Royal  Librarian. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        " 'What is the meaning of this fiasco?' he demanded. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        " 'Your Majesty,' said that official, 'either there is something radically  wrong with the bees--' </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        " 'There is nothing wrong with my bees,' said the king haughtily, 'they are  the best bees.' </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        " 'Or else,' said the Librarian, 'there is something irremediably right  about Prince Vespaluus.' </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        " 'If Vespaluus is right I must be wrong,' said the king. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The Librarian was silent for a moment. Hasty speech has been the downfall  of many; ill-considered silence was the undoing of the luckless Court  functionary. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Forgetting the restraint due to his dignity, and the golden rule which  imposes repose of mind and body after a heavy meal, the king rushed upon the  keeper of the royal books and hit him repeatedly and promiscuously over the head  with an ivory chess-board, a pewter wine-flagon, and a brass candlestick; he  knocked him violently and often against an iron torch sconce, and kicked him  thrice round the banqueting chamber with rapid, energetic kicks. Finally, he  dragged him down a long passage by the hair of his head and flung him out of a  window into the courtyard below." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Was he much hurt?" asked the Baroness. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "More hurt than surprised," said Clovis. "You see, the king was notorious  for his violent temper. However, this was the first time he had let himself go  so unrestrainedly on the top of a heavy meal. The Librarian lingered for many  days - in fact, for all I know, he may have ultimately recovered, but Hkrikros  died that same evening. Vespaluus had hardly finished getting the honey stains  off his body before a hurried deputation came to put the coronation oil on his  head. And what with the publicly-witnessed miracle and the accession of a  Christian sovereign, it was not surprising that there was a general scramble of  converts to the new religion. A hastily consecrated bishop was overworked with a  rush of baptisms in the hastily improvised Cathedral of St. Odilo. And the boy-martyr-that-might-have-been was transposed in the popular imagination  into a royal boy-saint, whose fame attracted throngs of curious and devout  sightseers to the capital. Vespaluus, who was busily engaged in organizing the  games and athletic contests that were to mark the commencement of his reign, had  no time to give heed to the religious fervour which was effervescing round his  personality; the first indication he had of the existing state of affairs was  when the Court Chamberlain (a recent and very ardent addition to the Christian  community) brought for his approval the outlines of a projected ceremonial  cutting-down of the idolatrous serpent-grove. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        " 'Your Majesty will be graciously pleased to cut down the first tree with a  specially consecrated axe,' said the obsequious official. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        " 'I'll cut off your head first, with any axe that comes handy,' said  Vespaluus indignantly; 'do you suppose that I'm going to begin my reign by  mortally affronting the sacred serpents? It would be most unlucky.' </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        " 'But your Majesty's Christian principles?' exclaimed the bewildered  Chamberlain. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        " 'I never had any,' said Vespaluus; 'I used to pretend to be a Christian  convert just to annoy Hkrikros. He used to fly into such delicious tempers. And  it was rather fun being whipped and scolded and shut up in a tower all for  nothing. But as to turning Christian in real earnest, like you people seem to  do, I couldn't think of such a thing. And the holy and esteemed serpents have  always helped me when I've prayed to them for success in my running and  wrestling and hunting, and it was through their distinguished intercession that  the bees were not able to hurt me with their stings. It would be black  ingratitude to turn against their worship at the very outset of my reign. I hate  you for suggesting it.' </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The Chamberlain wrung his hands despairingly. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        " 'But, your Majesty,' he wailed, 'the people are reverencing you as a  saint, and the nobles are being Christianized in batches, and neighbouring  potentates of that Faith are sending special envoys to welcome you as a brother.  There is some talk of making you the patron saint of beehives, and a certain  shade of honey-yellow has been christened Vespalussian gold at the Emperor's  Court. You can't surely go back on all this.' </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        " 'I don't mind being reverenced and greeted and honoured,' said Vespaluus;  'I don't even mind being sainted in moderation, as long as I'm not expected to  be saintly as well. But I wish you clearly and finally to understand that I will  not give up the worship of the august and auspicious serpents.' </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "There was a world of unspoken bear-pit in the way he uttered those last  words, and the mulberry-dark eyes flashed dangerously. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        " 'A new reign,' said the Chamberlain to himself, 'but the same old temper.' </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Finally, as a State necessity, the matter of the religions was compromised.  At stated intervals the king appeared before his subjects in the national  cathedral in the character of St. Vespaluus, and the idolatrous grove was  gradually pruned and lopped away till nothing remained of it. But the sacred and  esteemed serpents were removed to a private shrubbery in the royal gardens,  where Vespaluus the Pagan and certain members of his household devoutly and  decently worshipped them. That possibly is the reason why the boy-king's success  in sports and hunting never deserted him to the end of his days, and that is  also the reason why, in spite of the popular veneration for his sanctity, he  never received official canonization." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "It has stopped raining," said the Baroness.</div>
