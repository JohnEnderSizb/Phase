For God is but a         great will pervading all things by nature of its         intentness. Man doth not yield himself to the angels, nor         unto death utterly, save only through the weakness of his         feeble will.&mdash;        <i>Joseph Glanvill</i>.</blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I cannot, for my soul, remember how, when, or even precisely     where, I first became acquainted with the lady Ligeia. Long     years have since elapsed, and my memory is feeble through much     suffering. Or, perhaps, I cannot <i>now</i> bring these     points to mind, because, in truth, the character of my beloved,     her rare learning, her singular yet placid cast of beauty, and     the thrilling and enthralling eloquence of her low musical     language, made their way into my heart by paces so steadily and     stealthily progressive, that they have been unnoticed and     unknown. Yet I believe that I met her first and most frequently     in some large, old, decaying city near the Rhine. Of her     family&mdash;I have surely heard her speak. That it is of a     remotely ancient date cannot be doubted. Ligeia! Ligeia! Buried     in studies of a nature more than all else adapted to deaden     impressions of the outward world, it is by that sweet word     alone&mdash;by Ligeia&mdash;that I bring before mine eyes in     fancy the image of her who is no more. And now, while I write,     a recollection flashes upon me that I have <i>never known</i>     the paternal name of her who was my friend and my bethrothed,     and who became the partner of my studies, and finally the wife     of my bosom. Was it a playful charge on the part of my Ligeia?     or was it a test of my strength of affection, that I should     institute no inquiries upon this point? or was it rather a     caprice of my own&mdash;a wildly romantic offering on the     shrine of the most passionate devotion? I but indistinctly     recall the fact itself&mdash;what wonder that I have utterly     forgotten the circumstances which originated or attended it?     And, indeed, if ever that spirit which is entitled     <i>Romance</i>&mdash;if ever she, the wan misty-winged     <i>Ashtophet</i> of idolatrous Egypt, presided, as they tell,     over marriages ill-omened, then most surely she presided over     mine.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        There is one dear topic, however, on which my memory fails     me not. It is the <i>person</i> of Ligeia. In stature she was     tall, somewhat slender, and, in her latter days, even     emaciated. I would in vain attempt to portray the majesty, the     quiet ease of her demeanor, or the incomprehensible lightness     and elasticity of her footfall. She came and departed as a     shadow. I was never made aware of her entrance into my closed     study, save by the dear music of her low sweet voice, as she     placed her marble hand upon my shoulder. In beauty of face no     maiden ever equaled her. It was the radiance of an     opium-dream&mdash;an airy and spirit-lifting vision more wildly     divine than the phantasies which hovered about the slumbering     souls of the daughters of Delos. Yet her features were not of     that regular mold which we have been falsely taught to worship     in the classical labors of the heathen. "There is no exquisite     beauty," says Bacon, Lord Verulam, speaking truly of all the     forms and <i>genera</i> of beauty, "without some     <i>strangeness</i> in the proportion." Yet, although I saw     that the features of Ligeia were not of a classic     regularity&mdash;although I perceived that her loveliness was     indeed "exquisite," and felt that there was much of     "strangeness" pervading it, yet I have tried in vain to detect     the irregularity and to trace home my own perception of "the     strange." I examined the contour of the lofty and pale     forehead&mdash;it was faultless&mdash;how cold indeed that word     when applied to a majesty so divine!&mdash;the skin rivaling     the purest ivory, the commanding extent and repose, the gentle     prominence of the regions above the temples; and then the     raven-black, the glossy, the luxuriant, and naturally-curling     tresses, setting forth the full force of the Homeric epithet,     "hyacinthine!" I looked at the delicate outlines of the     nose&mdash;and nowhere but in the graceful medallions of the     Hebrews had I beheld a similar perfection. There were the same     luxurious smoothness of surface, the same scarcely perceptible     tendency to the aquiline, the same harmoniously curved nostrils     speaking the free spirit. I regarded the sweet mouth. Here was     indeed the triumph of all things heavenly&mdash;the magnificent     turn of the short upper lip&mdash;the soft, voluptuous slumber     of the under&mdash;the dimples which sported, and the color     which spoke&mdash;the teeth glancing back, with a brilliancy     almost startling, every ray of the holy light which fell upon     them in her serene and placid yet most exultingly radiant of     all smiles. I scrutinized the formation of the chin&mdash;and,     here, too, I found the gentleness of breadth, the softness and     the majesty, the fullness and the spirituality, of the     Greek&mdash;the contour which the god Apollo revealed but in a     dream, to Cleomenes, the son of the Athenian. And then I peered     into the large eyes of Ligeia.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        For eyes we have no models in the remotely antique. It might     have been, too, that in these eyes of my beloved lay the secret     to which Lord Verulam alludes. They were, I must believe, far     larger than the ordinary eyes of our own race. They were even     fuller than the fullest of the gazelle eyes of the tribe of the     valley of Nourjahad. Yet it was only at intervals&mdash;in     moments of intense excitement&mdash;that this peculiarity     became more than slightly noticeable in Ligeia. And at such     moments was her beauty&mdash;in my heated fancy thus it     appeared perhaps&mdash;the beauty of beings either above or     apart from the earth&mdash;the beauty of the fabulous Houri of     the Turk. The hue of the orbs was the most brilliant of black,     and, far over them, hung jetty lashes of great length. The     brows, slightly irregular in outline, had the same tint. The     "strangeness," however, which I found in the eyes was of a     nature distinct from the formation, or the color, or the     brilliancy of the features, and must, after all, be referred to     the <i>expression</i>. Ah, word of no meaning! behind whose     vast latitude of mere sound we intrench our ignorance of so     much of the spiritual. The expression of the eyes of Ligeia!     How for long hours have I pondered upon it! How have I, through     the whole of a midsummer night, struggled to fathom it! What     was it&mdash;that something more profound than the well of     Democritus&mdash;which lay far within the pupils of my beloved?     What <i>was</i> it? I was possessed with a passion to     discover. Those eyes! those large, those shining, those divine     orbs! they became to me twin stars of Leda, and I to them     devoutest of astrologers.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        There is no point, among the many incomprehensible anomalies     of the science of mind, more thrillingly exciting than the     fact&mdash;never, I believe, noticed in the schools&mdash;than     in our endeavors to recall to memory something long forgotten,     we often find ourselves <i>upon the very verge</i> of     remembrance, without being able, in the end, to remember. And     thus how frequently, in my intense scrutiny of Ligeia's eyes,     have I felt approaching the full knowledge of their     expression&mdash;felt it approaching&mdash;yet not quite be     mine&mdash;and so at length entirely depart! And (strange, oh,     strangest mystery of all!) I found, in the commonest objects of     the universe, a circle of analogies to that expression. I mean     to say that, subsequently to the period when Ligeia's beauty     passed into my spirit, there dwelling as in a shrine, I     derived, from many existences in the material world, a     sentiment such as I felt always around, within me, by her large     and luminous orbs. Yet not the more could I define that     sentiment, or analyze, or even steadily view it. I recognized     it, let me repeat, sometimes in the survey of a rapidly growing     vine&mdash;in the contemplation of a moth, a butterfly, a     chrysalis, a stream of running water. I have felt it in the     ocean&mdash;in the falling of a meteor. I have felt it in the     glances of unusually aged people. And there are one or two     stars in heaven (one especially, a star of the sixth magnitude,     double and changeable, to be found near the large star in Lyra)     in a telescopic scrutiny of which I have been made aware of the     feeling. I have been filled with it by certain sounds from     stringed instruments, and not unfrequently by passages from     books. Among innumerable other instances, I well remember     something in a volume of Joseph Glanvill, which (perhaps merely     from its quaintness&mdash;who shall say?) never failed to     inspire me with the sentiment: "And the will therein lieth,     which dieth not. Who knoweth the mysteries of the will, with     its vigor? For God is but a great will pervading all things by     nature of its intentness. Man doth not yield him to the angels,     nor unto death utterly, save only through the weakness of his     feeble will."</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Length of years and subsequent reflection have enabled me to     trace, indeed, some remote connection between this passage in     the English moralist and a portion of the character of Ligeia.     An <i>intensity</i> in thought, action, or speech was     possibly, in her, a result, or at least an index, of that     gigantic volition which, during our long intercourse, failed to     give other and more immediate evidence of its existence. Of all     the women whom I have ever known, she, the outwardly calm, the     ever-placid Ligeia, was the most violently a prey to the     tumultuous vultures of stern passion. And of such passion I     could form no estimate, save by the miraculous expansion of     those eyes which at once so delighted and appalled me,&mdash;by     the almost magical melody, modulation, distinctness, and     placidity of her very low voice,&mdash;and by the fierce energy     (rendered doubly effective by contrast with her manner of     utterance) of the wild words which she habitually uttered.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I have spoken of the learning of Ligeia: it was     immense&mdash;such as I have never known in woman. In the     classical tongues was she deeply proficient, and as far as my     own acquaintance extended in regard to the modern dialects of     Europe, I have never known her at fault. Indeed upon any theme     of the most admired because simply the most abstruse of the     boasted erudition of the Academy, have I <i>ever</i> found     Ligeia at fault? How singularly&mdash;how thrillingly, this one     point in the nature of my wife has forced itself, at this late     period only, upon my attention! I said her knowledge was such     as I have never known in woman&mdash;but where breathes the man     who has traversed, and successfully, <i>all</i> the wide     areas of moral, physical, and mathematical science? I saw not     then what I now clearly perceive that the acquisitions of     Ligeia were gigantic, were astounding; yet I was sufficiently     aware of her infinite supremacy to resign myself, with a     child-like confidence, to her guidance through the chaotic     world of metaphysical investigation at which I was most busily     occupied during the earlier years of our marriage. With how     vast a triumph&mdash;with how vivid a delight&mdash;with how     much of all that is ethereal in hope did I <i>feel</i>, as     she bent over me in studies but little sought&mdash;but less     known,&mdash;that delicious vista by slow degrees expanding     before me, down whose long, gorgeous, and all untrodden path, I     might at length pass onward to the goal of a wisdom too     divinely precious not to be forbidden.</p></div>

			<div class="pagers" id="6"><a href="Lige847.shtml.html#5"><b>&lt;</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="Lige847.shtml.html#6">6</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="Lige847.shtml.html#7"><b>&gt;</b></a></div>
			
			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        How poignant, then, must have been the grief with which,     after some years, I beheld my well-grounded expectations take     wings to themselves and fly away! Without Ligeia I was but as a     child groping benighted. Her presence, her readings alone,     rendered vividly luminous the many mysteries of the     transcendentalism in which we were immersed. Wanting the     radiant luster of her eyes, letters, lambent and golden, grew     duller than Saturnian lead. And now those eyes shone less and     less frequently upon the pages over which I pored. Ligeia grew     ill. The wild eyes blazed with a too&mdash;too glorious     effulgence; the pale fingers became of the transparent waxen     hue of the grave; and the blue veins upon the lofty forehead     swelled and sank impetuously with the tides of the most gentle     emotion. I saw that she must die&mdash;and I struggled     desperately in spirit with the grim Azrael. And the struggles     of the passionate wife were, to my astonishment, even more     energetic than my own. There had been much in her stern nature     to impress me with the belief that, to her, death would have     come without its terrors; but not so. Words are impotent to     convey any just idea of the fierceness of resistance with which     she wrestled with the Shadow. I groaned in anguish at the     pitiable spectacle. I would have soothed&mdash;I would have     reasoned; but in the intensity of her wild desire for     life&mdash;for life&mdash;<i>but</i> for life&mdash;solace     and reason were alike the uttermost of folly. Yet not until the     last instance, amid the most convulsive writhings of her fierce     spirit, was shaken the external placidity of her demeanor. Her     voice grew more gentle&mdash;grew more low&mdash;yet I would     not wish to dwell upon the wild meaning of the quietly uttered     words. My brain reeled as I hearkened, entranced, to a melody     more than mortal&mdash;to assumptions and aspirations which     mortality had never before known.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        That she loved me I should not have doubted; and I might     have been easily aware that, in a bosom such as hers, love     would have reigned no ordinary passion. But in death only was I     fully impressed with the strength of her affection. For long     hours, detaining my hand, would she pour out before me the     overflowing of a heart whose more than passionate devotion     amounted to idolatry. How had I deserved to be so blessed by     such confessions?&mdash;how had I deserved to be so cursed with     the removal of my beloved in the hour of my making them? But     upon this subject I cannot bear to dilate. Let me say only,     that in Ligeia's more than womanly abandonment to a love, alas!     all unmerited, all unworthily bestowed, I at length, recognized     the principle of her longing, with so wildly earnest a desire,     for the life which was now fleeing so rapidly away. It is this     wild longing&mdash;it is this eager vehemence of desire for     life&mdash;<i>but</i> for life&mdash;that I have no power to     portray&mdash;no utterance capable of expressing.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        At high noon of the night in which she departed, beckoning     me, peremptorily, to her side, she bade me repeat certain     verses composed by herself not many days before. I obeyed her.     They were these:&mdash;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote>Lo! 'tis a gala night              <BR>       Within the lonesome latter years!          <BR>       An angel throng, bewinged, bedight        <BR>       In veils, and drowned in tears,        </blockquote></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And now, as if exhausted with emotion, she suffered her     white arms to fall, and returned solemnly to her bed of death.     And as she breathed her last sighs, there came mingled with     them a low murmur from her lips. I bent to them my ear, and     distinguished, again, the concluding words of the passage in     Glanvill: "<i>Man doth not yield him to the angels, nor unto     death utterly, save only through the weakness of his feeble     will.</i>"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        She died: and I, crushed into the very dust with sorrow,     could no longer endure the lonely desolation of my dwelling in     the dim and decaying city by the Rhine. I had no lack of what     the world calls wealth. Ligeia had brought me far more, very     far more, than ordinarily falls to the lot of mortals. After a     few months, therefore, of weary and aimless wandering, I     purchased and put in some repair, an abbey, which I shall not     name, in one of the wildest and least frequented portions of     fair England. The gloomy and dreary grandeur of the building,     the almost savage aspect of the domain, the many melancholy and     time-honored memories connected with both, had much in unison     with the feelings of utter abandonment which had driven me into     that remote and unsocial region of the country. Yet although     the external abbey, with its verdant decay hanging about it,     suffered but little alteration, I gave way, with a child-like     perversity, and perchance with a faint hope of alleviating my     sorrows, to a display of more than regal magnificence within.     For such follies, even in childhood, I had imbibed a taste, and     now they came back to me as if in the dotage of grief. Alas, I     feel how much even of incipient madness might have been     discovered in the gorgeous and fantastic draperies, in the     solemn carvings of Egypt, in the wild cornices and furniture,     in the Bedlam patterns of the carpets of tufted gold! I had     become a bounden slave in the trammels of opium, and my labors     and my orders had taken a coloring from my dreams. But these     absurdities I must not pause to detail. Let me speak only of     that one chamber, ever accursed, whither, in a moment of mental     alienation, I led from the altar as my bride&mdash;as the     successor of the unforgotten Ligeia&mdash;the fair-haired and     blue-eyed Lady Rowena Trevanion, of Tremaine.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        There is no individual portion of the architecture and     decoration of that bridal chamber which is not visibly before     me. Where were the souls of the haughty family of the bride,     when, through thirst of gold, they permitted to pass the     threshold of an apartment <i>so</i> bedecked, a maiden and a     daughter so beloved? I have said, that I minutely remember the     details of the chamber&mdash;yet I am sadly forgetful on topics     of deep moment; and here there was no system, no keeping, in     the fantastic display to take hold upon the memory. The room     lay in a high turret of the castellated abbey, was pentagonal     in shape, and of capacious size. Occupying the whole southern     face of the pentagonal was the sole window&mdash;an immense     sheet of unbroken glass from Venice&mdash;a single pane, and     tinted of a leaden hue, so that the rays of either the sun or     moon passing through it, fell with a ghastly luster on the     objects within. Over the upper portion of this huge window     extended the trellis-work of an aged vine, which clambered up     the massy walls of the turret. The ceiling, of gloomy-looking     oak, was excessively lofty, vaulted, and elaborately fretted     with the wildest and most grotesque specimens of a semi-Gothic,     semi-Druidical device. From out the most central recess of this     melancholy vaulting, depended, by a single chain of gold with     long links, a huge censer of the same metal, Saracenic in     pattern, and with many perforations so contrived that there     writhed in and out of them, as if endued with a serpent     vitality, a continual succession of parti-colored fires.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Some few ottomans and golden candelabra, of Eastern figure,     were in various stations about; and there was the couch,     too&mdash;the bridal couch&mdash;of an Indian model, and low,     and sculptured of solid ebony, with a pall-like canopy above.     In each of the angles of the chamber stood on end a gigantic     sarcophagus of black granite, from the tombs of the kings over     against Luxor, with their aged lids full of immemorial     sculpture. But in the draping of the apartment lay, alas! the     chief phantasy of all. The lofty walls, gigantic in     height&mdash;even unproportionably so&mdash;were hung from     summit to foot, in vast folds, with a heavy and massive-looking     tapestry&mdash;tapestry of a material which was found alike as     a carpet on the floor, as a covering for the ottomans and the     ebony bed, as a canopy for the bed, and as the gorgeous volutes     of the curtains which partially shaded the window. The material     was the richest cloth of gold. It was spotted all over, at     irregular intervals, with arabesque figures, about a foot in     diameter, and wrought upon the cloth in patterns of the most     jetty black. But these figures partook of the true character of     the arabesque only when regarded from a single point of view.     By a contrivance now common, and indeed traceable to a very     remote period of antiquity, they were made changeable in     aspect. To one entering the room, they bore the appearance of     simple monstrosities; but upon a farther advance, this     appearance gradually departed; and, step by step, as the     visitor moved his station in the chamber, he saw himself     surrounded by an endless succession of the ghastly forms which     belong to the superstition of the Norman, or arise in the     guilty slumbers of the monk. The phantasmagoric effect was     vastly heightened by the artificial introduction of a strong     continual current of wind behind the draperies&mdash;giving a     hideous and uneasy animation to the whole.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        In halls such as these&mdash;in a bridal chamber such as     this&mdash;I passed, with the Lady of Tremaine, the unhallowed     hours of the first month of our marriage&mdash;passed them with     but little disquietude. That my wife dreaded the fierce     moodiness of my temper&mdash;that she shunned me, and loved me     but little&mdash;I could not help perceiving; but it gave me     rather pleasure than otherwise. I loathed her with a hatred     belonging more to demon than to man. My memory flew back (oh,     with what intensity of regret!) to Ligeia, the beloved, the     august, the beautiful, the entombed. I reveled in recollections     of her purity, of her wisdom, of her lofty&mdash;her ethereal     nature, of her passionate, her idolatrous love. Now, then, did     my spirit fully and freely burn with more than all the fires of     her own. In the excitement of my opium dreams (for I was     habitually fettered in the shackles of the drug), I would call     aloud upon her name, during the silence of the night, or among     the sheltered recesses of the glens by day, as if, through the     wild eagerness, the solemn passion, the consuming ardor of my     longing for the departed, I could restore her to the pathways     she had abandoned&mdash;ah, <i>could</i> it be     forever?&mdash;upon the earth.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        About the commencement of the second month of the marriage,     the Lady Rowena was attacked with sudden illness, from which     her recovery was slow. The fever which consumed her rendered     her nights uneasy; and in her perturbed state of half-slumber,     she spoke of sounds, and of motions, in and about the chamber     of the turret, which I concluded had no origin save in the     distemper of her fancy, or perhaps in the phantasmagoric     influences of the chamber itself. She became at length     convalescent&mdash;finally, well. Yet but a second more violent     disorder again threw her upon a bed of suffering; and from this     attack her frame, at all times feeble, never altogether     recovered. Her illnesses were, after this epoch, of alarming     character, and of more alarming recurrence, defying alike the     knowledge and the great exertions of her physicians. With the     increase of the chronic disease, which had thus, apparently,     taken too sure hold upon her constitution to be eradicated by     human means, I could not fail to observe a similar increase in     the nervous irritation of her temperament, and in her     excitability by trivial causes of fear. She spoke again, and     now more frequently and pertinaciously, of the sounds&mdash;of     the slight sounds&mdash;and of the unusual motions among the     tapestries, to which she had formerly alluded.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        One night, near the closing in of September, she pressed     this distressing subject with more than usual emphasis upon my     attention. She had just awakened from an unquiet slumber, and I     had been watching, with feelings half of anxiety, half of vague     terror, the workings of her emaciated countenance. I sat by the     side of her ebony bed, upon one of the ottomans of India. She     partly arose, and spoke, in an earnest low whisper, of sounds     which she <i>then</i> heard, but which I could not     hear&mdash;of motions which she <i>then</i> saw, but which I     could not perceive. The wind was rushing hurriedly behind the     tapestries, and I wished to show her (what, let me confess it,     I could not <i>all</i> believe) that those almost     inarticulate breathings, and those very gentle variations of     the figures upon the wall, were but the natural effects of that     customary rushing of the wind. But a deadly pallor,     overspreading her face, had proved to me that my exertions to     reassure her would be fruitless. She appeared to be fainting,     and no attendants were within call. I remembered where was     deposited a decanter of light wine which had been ordered by     her physicians, and hastened across the chamber to procure it.     But, as I stepped beneath the light of the censer, two     circumstances of a startling nature attracted my attention. I     had felt that some palpable although invisible object had     passed lightly by my person; and I saw that there lay upon the     golden carpet, in the very middle of the rich luster thrown     from the censer, a shadow&mdash;a faint, indefinite shadow of     angelic aspect&mdash;such as might be fancied for the shadow of     a shade. But I was wild with the excitement of an immoderate     dose of opium, and heeded these things but little, nor spoke of     them to Rowena. Having found the wine, I recrossed the chamber,     and poured out a gobletful, which I held to the lips of the     fainting lady. She had now partially recovered, however, and     took the vessel herself, while I sank upon an ottoman near me,     with my eyes fastened upon her person. It was then that I     became distinctly aware of a gentle footfall upon the carpet,     and near the couch; and in a second thereafter, as Rowena was     in the act of raising the wine to her lips, I saw, or may have     dreamed that I saw, fall within the goblet, as if from some     invisible spring in the atmosphere of the room, three or four     large drops of a brilliant and ruby colored fluid. If this I     saw&mdash;not so Rowena. She swallowed the wine unhesitatingly,     and I forebore to speak to her of a circumstance which must,     after all, I considered, have been but the suggestion of a     vivid imagination, rendered morbidly active by the terror of     the lady, by the opium, and by the hour.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Yet I cannot <ins class="correction"          title="Transcriber's note: The original reads &quot;coneal&quot;.">     conceal</ins> it from my own perception that, immediately     subsequent to the fall of the ruby drops, a rapid change for     the worse took place in the disorder of my wife; so that, on     the third subsequent night, the hands of her menials prepared     her for the tomb, and on the fourth, I sat alone, with her     shrouded body, in that fantastic chamber which had received her     as my bride. Wild visions, opium-engendered, flitted,     shadow-like, before me. I gazed with unquiet eye upon the     sarcophagi in the angles of the room, upon the varying figures     of the drapery, and upon the writhing of the parti-colored     fires in the censer overhead. My eyes then fell, as I called to     mind the circumstances of a former night, to the spot beneath     the glare of the censer where I had seen the faint traces of     the shadow. It was there, however, no longer; and breathing     with greater freedom, I turned my glances to the pallid and     rigid figure upon the bed. Then rushed upon me a thousand     memories of Ligeia&mdash;and then came back upon my heart, with     the turbulent violence of a flood, the whole of that     unutterable woe with which I had regarded <i>her</i> thus     enshrouded. The night waned; and still, with a bosom full of     bitter thoughts of the one only and supremely beloved, I     remained gazing upon the body of Rowena.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        It might have been midnight, or perhaps earlier, or later,     for I had taken no note of time, when a sob, low, gentle, but     very distinct, startled me from my revery. I <i>felt</i> that     it came from the bed of ebony&mdash;the bed of death. I     listened in an agony of superstitious terror&mdash;but there     was no repetition of the sound. I strained my vision to detect     any motion in the corpse&mdash;but there was not the slightest     perceptible. Yet I could not have been deceived. I <i>had</i>     heard the noise, however faint, and my soul was awakened within     me. I resolutely and perseveringly kept my attention riveted     upon the body. Many minutes elapsed before any circumstance     occurred tending to throw light upon the mystery. At length it     became evident that a slight, a very feeble, and barely     noticeable tinge of color had flushed up within the cheeks, and     along the sunken small veins of the eyelids. Through a species     of unutterable horror and awe, for which the language of     mortality has no sufficiently energetic expression, I felt my     heart cease to beat, my limbs grow rigid where I sat. Yet a     sense of duty finally operated to restore my self-possession. I     could no longer doubt that we had been precipitate in our     preparations&mdash;that Rowena still lived. It was necessary     that some immediate exertion be made; yet the turret was     altogether apart from the portion of the abbey tenanted by the     servants&mdash;there were none within call&mdash;I had no means     of summoning them to my aid without leaving the room for many     minutes&mdash;and this I could not venture to do. I therefore     struggled alone in my endeavors to call back the spirit still     hovering. In a short period it was certain, however, that a     relapse had taken place; the color disappeared from both eyelid     and cheek, leaving a wanness even more than that of marble; the     lips became doubly shriveled and pinched up in the ghastly     expression of death; a repulsive clamminess and coldness     overspread rapidly the surface of the body; and all the usual     rigorous stiffness immediately supervened. I fell back with a     shudder upon the couch from which I had been so startlingly     aroused, and again gave myself up to passionate waking visions     of Ligeia.</p></div>

			<div class="pagers" id="15"><a href="Lige847.shtml.html#14"><b>&lt;</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="Lige847.shtml.html#15">15</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="Lige847.shtml.html#16"><b>&gt;</b></a></div>
			
			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        An hour thus elapsed, when (could it be possible?) I was a     second time aware of some vague sound issuing from the region     of the bed. I listened&mdash;in extremity of horror. The sound     came again&mdash;it was a sigh. Rushing to the corpse, I     saw&mdash;distinctly saw&mdash;a tremor upon the lips. In a     minute afterward they relaxed, disclosing a bright line of the     pearly teeth. Amazement now struggled in my bosom with the     profound awe which had hitherto reigned there alone. I felt     that my vision grew dim, that my reason wandered; and it was     only by a violent effort that I at length succeeded in nerving     myself to the task which duty thus once more had pointed out.     There was now a partial glow upon the forehead and upon the     cheek and throat; a perceptible warmth pervaded the whole     frame; there was even a slight pulsation at the heart. The lady     <i>lived</i>; and with redoubled ardor I betook myself to the     task of restoration. I chafed and bathed the temples and the     hands and used every exertion which experience, and no little     medical reading, could suggest. But in vain. Suddenly, the     color fled, the pulsation ceased, the lips resumed the     expression of the dead, and, in an instant afterward, the whole     body took upon itself the icy chilliness, the livid hue, the     intense rigidity, the sunken outline, and all the loathsome     peculiarities of that which has been, for many days, a tenant     of the tomb.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And again I sunk into visions of Ligeia&mdash;and again     (what marvel that I shudder while I write?), <i>again</i>     there reached my ears a low sob from the region of the ebony     bed. But why shall I minutely detail the unspeakable horrors of     that night? Why shall I pause to relate how, time after time,     until near the period of the gray dawn, this hideous drama of     revivification was repeated; how each terrific relapse was only     into a sterner and apparently more irredeemable death; how each     agony wore the aspect of a struggle with some invisible foe;     and how each struggle was succeeded by I know not what of wild     change in the personal appearance of the corpse? Let me hurry     to a conclusion.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The greater part of the fearful night had worn away, and she     who had been dead once again stirred&mdash;and now more     vigorously than hitherto, although arousing from a dissolution     more appalling in its utter hopelessness than any. I had long     ceased to struggle or to move, and remained sitting rigidly     upon the ottoman, a helpless prey to a whirl of violent     emotions, of which extreme awe was perhaps the least terrible,     the least consuming. The corpse, I repeat, stirred, and now     more vigorously than before. The hues of life flushed up with     unwonted energy into the countenance&mdash;the limbs     relaxed&mdash;and, save that the eyelids were yet pressed     heavily together, and that the bandages and draperies of the     grave still imparted their charnel character to the figure, I     might have dreamed that Rowena had indeed shaken off, utterly,     the fetters of Death. But if this idea was not, even then,     altogether adopted, I could at least doubt no longer, when,     arising from the bed, tottering, with feeble steps, with closed     eyes, and with the manner of one bewildered in a dream, the     thing that was enshrouded advanced boldly and palpably into the     middle of the apartment.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I trembled not&mdash;I stirred not&mdash;for a crowd of     unutterable fancies connected with the air, the stature, the     demeanor, of the figure, rushing hurriedly through my brain,     had paralyzed&mdash;had chilled me into stone. I stirred     not&mdash;but gazed upon the apparition. There was a mad     disorder in my thoughts&mdash;a tumult unappeasable. Could it,     indeed, be the <i>living</i> Rowena who confronted me? Could     it, indeed, be Rowena <i>at all</i>&mdash;the fair-haired,     the blue-eyed Lady Rowena Trevanion of Tremaine? Why,     <i>why</i> should I doubt it? The bandage lay heavily about     the mouth&mdash;but then might it not be the mouth of the     breathing Lady of Tremaine? And the cheeks&mdash;there were the     roses as in her noon of life&mdash;yes, these might indeed be     the fair cheeks of the living Lady of Tremaine. And the chin,     with its dimples, as in health, might it not be hers?&mdash;but     <i>had she then grown taller since her malady?</i> What     inexpressible madness seized me with that thought? One bound,     and I had reached her feet! Shrinking from my touch, she let     fall from her head, unloosened, the ghastly cerements which had     confined it, and there streamed forth into the rushing     atmosphere of the chamber huge masses of long and disheveled     hair; <i>it was blacker than the raven wings of midnight.</i>     And now slowly opened <i>the eyes</i> of the figure which     stood before me. "Here then, at least," I shrieked aloud, "can     I never&mdash;can I never be mistaken&mdash;these are the full,     and the black, and the wild eyes&mdash;of my lost love&mdash;of     the Lady&mdash;of the LADY LIGEIA."</div>
