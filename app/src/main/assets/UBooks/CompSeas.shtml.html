<div class="story_text" id="1"><p>There are no more Christmas stories to write.  Fiction is exhausted;  and newspaper items, the next best, are manufactured by clever  young journalists who have married early and have an engagingly  pessimistic view of life.  Therefore, for seasonable diversion, we  are reduced to very questionable sources - facts and philosophy.   We will begin with - whichever you choose to call it. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Children are pestilential little animals with which we have to cope  under a bewildering variety of conditions.  Especially when  childish sorrows overwhelm them are we put to our wits' end.  We  exhaust our paltry store of consolation; and then beat them,  sobbing, to sleep.  Then we grovel in the dust of a million years,  and ask God why.  Thus we call out of the rat-trap.  As for the  children, no one understands them except old maids, hunchbacks,  and shepherd dogs. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Now comes the facts in the case of the Rag-Doll, the Tatterdemalion,  and the Twenty-fifth of December. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        On the tenth of that month the Child of the Millionaire lost her  rag-doll.  There were many servants in the Millionaire's palace on  the Hudson, and these ransacked the house and grounds, but without  finding the lost treasure.  The child was a girl of five, and one  of those perverse little beasts that often wound the sensibilities  of wealthy parents by fixing their affections upon some vulgar,  inexpensive toy instead of upon diamond-studded automobiles and  pony phaetons. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The Child grieved sorely and truly, a thing inexplicable to the  Millionaire, to whom the rag-doll market was about as interesting  as Bay State Gas; and to the Lady, the Child's mother, who was all  form - that is, nearly all, as you shall see. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The Child cried inconsolably, and grew hollow-eyed, knock-kneed,  spindling, and corykilverty in many other respects.  The Millionaire  smiled and tapped his coffers confidently.  The pick of the output  of the French and German toymakers was rushed by special delivery  to the mansion; but Rachel refused to be comforted.  She was weeping  for her rag child, and was for a high protective tariff against all  foreign foolishness.  Then doctors with the finest bedside manners  and stop-watches were called in.  One by one they chattered futilely  about peptomanganate of iron and sea voyages and hypophosphites  until their stop-watches showed that Bill Rendered was under the  wire for show or place.  Then, as men, they advised that the  rag-doll be found as soon as possible and restored to its mourning  parent.  The Child sniffed at therapeutics, chewed a thumb, and  wailed for her Betsy.  And all this time cablegrams were coming  from Santa Claus saying that he would soon be here and enjoining us  to show a true Christian spirit and let up on the pool-rooms and  tontine policies and platoon systems long enough to give him a  welcome.  Everywhere the spirit of Christmas was diffusing itself.   The banks were refusing loans, the pawn-brokers had doubled their  gang of helpers, people bumped your shins on the streets with red  sleds, Thomas and Jeremiah bubbled before you on the bars while you  waited on one foot, holly-wreaths of hospitality were hung in windows  of the stores, they who had 'em were getting their furs.  You hardly  knew which was the best bet in balls - three, high, moth, or snow.   It was no time at which to lose the rag-doll or your heart. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        If Doctor Watson's investigating friend had been called in to  solve this mysterious disappearance he might have observed on the  Millionaire's wall a copy of "The Vampire."  That would have  quickly suggested, by induction, "A rag and a bone and a hank of  hair."  "Flip," a Scotch terrier, next to the rag-doll in the Child's  heart, frisked through the halls.  The hank of hair!  Aha!  X, the  unfound quantity, represented the rag-doll.  But, the bone?  Well,  when dogs find bones they - Done!  It were an easy and a fruitful  task to examine Flip's forefeet.  Look, Watson!  Earth - dried earth  between the toes.  Of course, the dog - but Sherlock was not there.   Therefore it devolves.  But topography and architecture must  intervene. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The Millionaire's palace occupied a lordly space.  In front of it  was a lawn close-mowed as a South Ireland man's face two days after  a shave.  At one side of it, and fronting on another street was  a pleasuance trimmed to a leaf, and the garage and stables.  The  Scotch pup had ravished the rag-doll from the nursery, dragged it  to a corner of the lawn, dug a hole, and buried it after the manner  of careless undertakers.  There you have the mystery solved, and  no checks to write for the hypodermical wizard of fi'-pun notes to  toss to the sergeant.  Then let's get down to the heart of the thing,  tiresome readers - the Christmas heart of the thing. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Fuzzy was drunk - not riotously or helplessly or loquaciously, as  you or I might get, but decently, appropriately, and inoffensively,  as becomes a gentleman down on his luck. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Fuzzy was a soldier of misfortune.  The road, the haystack, the  park bench, the kitchen door, the bitter round of eleemosynary  beds-with-shower-bath-attachment, the petty pickings and ignobly  garnered largesse of great cities - these formed the chapters of his  history. </p></div>

			<div class="pagers" id="3"><a href="CompSeas.shtml.html#2"><b>&lt;</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="CompSeas.shtml.html#3">3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="CompSeas.shtml.html#4"><b>&gt;</b></a></div>
			
			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Fuzzy walked toward the river, down the street that bounded one  side of the Millionaire's house and grounds.  He saw a leg of  Betsy, the lost rag-doll, protruding, like the clue to a Lilliputian  murder mystery, from its untimely grave in a corner of the fence.   He dragged forth the maltreated infant, tucked it under his arm,  and went on his way crooning a road song of his brethrren that no  doll that has been brought up to the sheltered life should hear.   Well for Betsy that she had no ears.  And well that she had no eyes  save unseeing circles of black; for the faces of Fuzzy and the  Scotch terrier were those of brothers, and the heart of no rag-doll  could withstand twice to become the prey of such fearsome  monsters. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Though you may not know it, Grogan's saloon stands near the river  and near the foot of the street down which Fuzzy traveled.  In  Grogan's, Christmas cheer was already rampant. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Fuzzy entered with his doll.  He fancied that as a mummer at the  feast of Saturn he might earn a few drops from the wassail cup. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He set Betsy on the bar and addressed her loudly and humorously,  seasoning his speech with exaggerated compliments and endearments,  as one entertaining his lady friend.  The loafers and bibbers  around caught the farce of it, and roared.  The bartender gave  Fuzzy a drink.  Oh, many of us carry rag-dolls. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "One for the lady?" suggested Fuzzy impudently, and tucked another  contribution to Art beneath his waistcoat. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He began to see possibilities in Betsy.  His first-night had been  a success.  Visions of a vaudeville circuit about town dawned upon  him. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        In a group near the stove sat "Pigeon" McCarthy, Black Riley, and  "One-ear" Mike, well and unfavorably known in the tough shoestring  district that blackened the left bank of the river.  They passed  a newspaper back and forth among themselves.  The item that each  solid and blunt forefinger pointed out was an advertisement headed  "One Hundred Dollars Reward."  To earn it one must return the  rag-doll lost, strayed, or stolen from the Millionaire's mansion.   It seemed that grief still ravaged, unchecked, in the bosom of  the too faithful Child.  Flip, the terrier, capered and shook his  absurd whisker before her, powerless to distract.  She wailed  for her Betsy in the faces of walking, talking, mama-ing, and  eye-closing French Mabelles and Violettes.  The advertisement  was a last resort. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Black Riley came from behind the stove and approached Fuzzy in  his one-sided parabolic way. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The Christmas mummer, flushed with success, had tucked Betsy under  his arm, and was about to depart to the filling of impromptu dates  elsewhere. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Say, 'Bo," said Black Riley to him, "where did you cop out dat  doll?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "This doll?" asked Fuzzy, touching Betsy with his forefinger to be  sure that she was the one referred to.  his doll was presented to  me by the Emperor of Beloochistan.  I have seven hundred others in  my country home in Newport.  This doll -" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Cheese the funny business," said Riley.  "You swiped it or picked  it up at de house on de hill where - but never mind dat.  You want  to take fifty cents for de rags, and take it quick.  Me brother's  kid at home might be wantin' to play wid it.  Hey - what?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He produced the coin. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Fuzzy laughed a gurgling, insolent, alcoholic laugh in his face.   Go to the office of Sarah Bernhardt's manager and propose to him  that she be released from a night's performance to entertain  the Tackytown Lyceum and Literary Coterie.  You will hear the  duplicate of Fuzzy's laugh. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Black Riley gauged Fuzzy quickly with his blueberry eye as a  wrestler does.  His hand was itching to play the Roman and wrest  the rag Sabine from the extemporaneous merry-andrew who was  entertaining an angel unaware.  But he refrained.  Fuzzy was fat  and solid and big.  Three inches of well-nourished corporeity,  defended from the winter winds by dingy linen, intervened between  his vest and trousers.  Countless small, circular wrinkles  running around his coat-sleeves and knees guaranteed the quality  of his bone and muscle.  His small, blue eyes, bathed in the  moisture of altruism and wooziness, looked upon you kindly, yet  without abashment.  He was whiskerly, whiskyly, fleshily  formidable.  So, Black Riley temporized. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Wot'll you take for it, den?" he asked. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Money," said Fuzzy, with husky firmness, "cannot buy her." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He was intoxicated with the artist's first sweet cup of attainment.   To set a faded-blue, earth-stained rag-doll on a bar, to hold mimic  converse with it, and to find his heart leaping with the sense of  plaudits earned and his throat scorching with free libations poured  in his honor - could base coin buy him from such achievements?  You  will perceive that Fuzzy had the temperament. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Fuzzy walked out with the gait of a trained sea-lion in search of  other caf'es to conquer. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Though the dusk of twilight was hardly yet apparent, lights were  beginning to spangle the city like pop-corn bursting in a deep  skillet.  Christmas Eve, impatiently expected, was peeping over  the brink of the hour.  Millions had prepared for its celebration.   Towns would be painted red.  You, yourself, have heard the horns  and dodged the capers of the Saturnalians. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Pigeon" McCarthy, Black Riley, and "One-ear" Mike held a hasty  converse outside Grogan's.  They were narrow-chested, pallid  striplings, not fighters in the open, but more dangerous in their  ways of warfare than the most terrible of Turks.  Fuzzy, in a  pitched battle, could have eaten the three of them.  In a go-as-you-please encounter he was already doomed. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        They overtook him just as he and Betsy were entering Costigan's  Casino.  They deflected him, and shoved the newspaper under his  nose.  Fuzzy could read - and more. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Boys," said he, "you are certainly damn true friends.  Give me a  week to think it over." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The soul of a real artist is quenched with difficulty. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The boys carefully pointed out to him that advertisements were  soulless, and that the deficiencies of the day might not be supplied  by the morrow. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "A cool hundred," said Fuzzy thoughtfully and mushily. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Booys," said he, "you are true friends.  I'll go up and claim the  reward.  The show business is not what it used to be." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Night was falling more surely.  The three tagged at his sides to  the foot of the rise on which stood the Millionaire's house.  There  Fuzzy turned upon them acrimoniously. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "You are a pack of putty-faced beagle-hounds," he roared.  "Go  away." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        They went away - a little way. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        In "Pigeon" McCarthy's pocket was a section of one-inch gas-pipe  eight inches long.  In one end of it and in the middle of it was  a lead plug.  One-half of it was packed tight with solder.  Black  Riley carried a slung-shot, being a conventional thug.  "One-ear"  Mike relied upon a pair of brass knucks - an heirloom in the  family. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Why fetch and carry," said Black Riley, "when some one will do  it for ye?  Let him bring it out to us.  Hey - what?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "We can chuck him in the river," said "Pigeon" McCarthy, "with a  stone tied to his feet." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Youse guys make me tired," said "One-ear" Mike sadly.  "Ain't  progress ever appealed to none of yez?  Sprinkle a little gasoline  on 'im, and drop 'im on the Drive - well?" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Fuzzy entered the Millionaire's gate and zigzagged toward the  softly glowing entrance of the mansion.  The three goblins came up  to the gate and lingered - one on each side of it, one beyond the  roadway.  They fingered their cold metal and leather, confident. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Fuzzy rang the door-bell, smiling foolishly and dreamily.  An  atavistic instrinct prompted him to reach for the button of his right  glove.  But he wore no gloves; so his left hand dropped, embarrassed. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The particular menial whose duty it was to open doors to silks and  laces shied at first sight of Fuzzy.  But a second glance took in  his passport, his card of admission, his surety of welcome - the lost  rag-doll of the daughter of the house dangling under his arm. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Fuzzy was admitted into a great hall, dim with the glow from  unseen lights.  The hireling went away and returned with a maid  and the Child.  The doll was restored to the mourning one.  She  clasped her lost darling to her breast; and then, with the  inordinate selfishness and candor of childhood, stamped her foot  and whined hatred and fear of the odious being who had rescued her  from the depths of sorrow and despair.  Fuzzy wriggled himself  into an ingratiatory attitude and essayed the idiotic smile and  blattering small talk that is supposed to charm the budding  intellect of the young.  The Child bawled, and was dragged away,  hugging her Betsy close. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        There came the Secretary, pale, poised, polished, gliding in  pumps, and worshipping pomp and ceremony.  He counted out into  Fuzzy's hand ten ten-dollar bills; then dropped his eye upon  the door, transferred it to James, its custodian, indicated the  obnoxious earner of the reward with the other, and allowed his  pumps to waft him away to secretarial regions. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        James gathered Fuzzy with his own commanding optic and swept him  as far as the front door. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        When the money touched fuzzy's dingy palm his first instinct was  to take to his heels; but a second thought restrained him from that  blunder of etiquette.  It was his; it had been given him.  It - and,  oh, what an elysium it opened to the gaze of his mind's eye!  He  had tumbled to the foot of the ladder; he was hungry, homeless,  friendless, ragged, cold, drifting; and he held in his hand the key  to a paradise of the mud-honey that he craved.  The fairy doll had  waved a wand with her rag-stuffed hand; and now wherever he might go  the enchanted palaces with shining foot-rests and magic red fluids  in gleaming glassware would be open to him. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He followed James to the door. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He paused there as the flunky drew open the great mahogany portal  for him to pass into the vestibule. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Beyond the wrought-iron gates in the dark highway Black Riley and his  two pals casually strolled, fingering under their coats the inevitably  fatal weapons that were to make the reward of the rag-doll theirs. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Fuzzy stopped at the Millionaire's door and bethought himself.   Like little sprigs of mistletoe on a dead tree, certain living green  thoughts and memories began to decorate his confused mind.  He was  quite drunk, mind you, and the present was beginning to fade.  Those  wreaths aand festoons of holly with their scarlet berries making  the great hall gay - where had he seen such things before?  Somewhere  he had known polished floors and odors of fresh flowers in winter,  and - and some one was singing a song in the house that he thought  he had heard before.  Some one singing and playing a harp.  Of course,  it was Christmas - Fuzzy though he must have been pretty drunk to have  overlooked that. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And then he went out of the present, and there came back to him  out of some impossible, vanished, and irrevocable past a little,  pure-white, transient, forgotten ghost - the spirit of <i>nobless  oblige</i>.  Upon a gentleman certain things devolve. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        James opened the outer door.  A stream of light went down the  graveled walk to the iron gate.  Black Riley, McCarthy, and  "One-ear" Mike saw, and carelessly drew their sinister cordon closer  about the gate. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        With a more imperious gesture than James's master had ever used  or could ever use, Fuzzy compelled the menial to close the door.   Upon a gentleman certain things devolve.  Especially at the  Christmas season. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "It is cust - customary," he said to James, the flustered, "when  a gentleman calls on Christmas Eve to pass the compliments of the  season with the lady of the house.  You und'stand?  I shall not  move shtep till I pass compl'ments season with lady the house.   Und'stand?" </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        There was an argument.  James lost.  Fuzzy raised his voice and  sent it through the house unpleasantly.  I did not say he was a  gentleman.  He was simply a tramp being visited by a ghost. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        A sterling silver bell rang.  James went back to answer it, leaving  Fuzzy in the hall.  James explained somewhere to some one. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Then he came and conducted Fuzzy into the library. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The lady entered a moment later.  She was more beautiful and holy  than any picture that Fuzzy had seen.  She smiled, and said  something about a doll.  Fuzzy didn't understand that; he  remembered nothing about a doll. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        A footman brought in two small glasses of sparkling wine on a  stamped sterling-silver waiter.  The Lady took one.  The other was  handed to Fuzzy. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        As his fingers closed on the slender glass stem his disabilities  dropped from him for one brief moment.  He straightened himself;  and Time, so disobliging to most of us, turned backward to  accomodate Fuzzy. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Forgotten Christmas ghosts whiter than the false beards of the  most opulent Kris Kringle were rising in the fumes of Grogan's  whisky.  What had the Millionaire's mansion to do with a long,  wainscoted Virginia hall, where the riders were grouped around a  silver punch-bowl, drinking the ancient toast of the House?  And  why should the patter of the cab horses' hoofs on the frozen street  be in any wise related to the sound of the saddled hunters stamping  under the shelter of the west veranda?  And what had Fuzzy to do  with any of it? </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The Lady, looking at him over her glass, let her condescending  smile fade away like a false dawn.  Her eyes turned serious.  She  saw something beneath the rags and Scotch terrier whiskers that  she did not understand.  But it did not matter. </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Fuzzy lifted his glass and smiled vacantly. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "P-pardon, lady," he said, "but couldn't leave without exchangin'  comp'ments sheason with lady th' house.  'Gainst princ'ples  gen'leman do sho." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And then he began the ancient salutation that was a tradition in the  House when men wore lace ruffles and powder. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The blessings of another year -" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Fuzzy's memory failed him.  The Lady prompted: </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "- Be upon this hearth." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "- The guest -" stammered Fuzzy. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "- And upon her who -" continued the Lady, with a leading smile. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Oh, cut it out," said Fuzzy, ill-manneredly.  "I can't remember.   Drink hearty." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Fuzzy had shot his arrow.  They drank.  The Lady smiled again the  smile of her caste.  James enveloped and re-conducted him toward  the front door.  The harp music still softly drifted through the  house. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Outside, Black Riley breathed on his cold hands and hugged the  gate. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I wonder," said the Lady to herself, musing, "who - but there were  so many who came.  I wonder whether memory is a curse or a blessing  to them after they have fallen so low." </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Fuzzy and his escort were nearly at the door.  The Lady called:   "James!" </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        James stalked back obsequiously, leaving Fuzzy waiting unsteadily,  with his brief spark of the divine fire gone. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Outside, Black Riley stamped his cold feet and got a firmer grip  on his section of gas-pipe. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "You will conduct this gentleman," said the lady, "Downstairs.   Then tell Louis to get out the Mercedes and take him to whatever  place he wishes to go."</div>
