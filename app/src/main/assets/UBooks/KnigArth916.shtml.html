Engdahl just came in over the big bridge, but I  had Arthur with me so I had to  come the long way around.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        When I registered at the desk,  I said I was from Chicago. You  know how it is. If you say you're  from Philadelphia, it's like saying  you're from St. Louis or  Detroit &mdash; I mean <i>nobody</i> lives in  Philadelphia any more. Shows  how things change. A couple years  ago, Philadelphia was all the  fashion. But not now, and I  wanted to make a good impression.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I even tipped the bellboy a  hundred and fifty dollars. I said:  "Do me a favor. I've got my baggage  booby-trapped &mdash; "</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Natch," he said, only mildly  impressed by the bill and a half,  even less impressed by me.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I mean <i>really</i> booby-trapped.  Not just a burglar alarm. Besides  the alarm, there's a little surprise on a short fuse. So what I want  you to do, if you hear the alarm go  off, is come running. Right?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "And get my head blown off?"  He slammed my bags onto the  floor. "Mister, you can take your  damn money and &mdash; "</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Wait a minute, friend." I passed  over another hundred. "Please?  It's only a shaped charge. It won't  hurt anything except anybody who  messes around, see? But I don't  want it to go off. So you come  running when you hear the alarm  and scare him away and &mdash; "</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "No!" But he was less positive.  I gave him two hundred more and  he said grudgingly: "All right. If  I hear it. Say, what's in there that's  worth all that trouble?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Papers," I lied.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He leered. "Sure."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "No fooling, it's just personal  stuff. Not worth a penny to anybody  but me, understand? So  don't get any ideas &mdash; "</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He said in an injured tone:  "Mister, naturally the <i>staff</i> won't  bother your stuff. What kind of a  hotel do you think this is?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Of course, of course," I said.  But I knew he was lying, because  I knew what kind of hotel it was.  The staff was there only because  being there gave them a chance  to knock down more money than  they could make any other way.  What other kind of hotel was  there?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Anyway, the way to keep the  staff on my side was by bribery,  and when he left I figured I had  him at least temporarily bought.  He promised to keep an eye on  the room and he would be on duty  for four more hours &mdash; which gave  me plenty of time for my errands.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I made sure Arthur was  plugged in and cleaned myself  up. They had water running &mdash; New  York's very good that way;  they always have water running.  It was even hot, or nearly hot. I  let the shower splash over me for  a while, because there was a lot  of dust and dirt from the Bronx  that I had to get off me. The way  it looked, hardly anybody had  been up that way since it happened.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I dried myself, got dressed and  looked out the window. We were  fairly high up &mdash; fifteenth floor. I  could see the Hudson and the big  bridge up north of us. There was  a huge cloud of smoke coming  from somewhere near the bridge  on the other side of the river, but  outside of that everything looked  normal. You would have thought  there were people in all those  houses. Even the streets looked  pretty good, until you noticed that  hardly any of the cars were moving.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I opened the little bag and  loaded my pockets with enough  money to run my errands. At the  door, I stopped and called over my shoulder to Arthur: "Don't  worry if I'm gone an hour or so.  I'll be back."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I didn't wait for an answer.  That would have been pointless  under the circumstances.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        After Philadelphia, this place  seemed to be bustling with activity.  There were four or five  people in the lobby and a couple  of dozen more out in the street.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I tarried at the desk for several  reasons. In the first place, I was  expecting Vern Engdahl to try to  contact me and I didn't want him  messing with the luggage &mdash; not  while Arthur might get nervous.  So I told the desk clerk that in  case anybody came inquiring for  Mr. Schlaepfer, which was the  name I was using &mdash; my real name  being Sam Dunlap &mdash; he was to be  told that on no account was he to  go to my room but to wait in the  lobby; and in any case I would  be back in an hour.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Sure," said the desk clerk,  holding out his hand.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I crossed it with paper. "One  other thing," I said. "I need to buy  an electric typewriter and some  other stuff. Where can I get  them?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "PX," he said promptly.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "PX?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "What used to be Macy's," he  explained. "You go out that door  and turn right. It's only about a  block. You'll see the sign."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Thanks." That cost me a hundred  more, but it was worth it.  After all, money wasn't a problem &mdash; not  when we had just come from  Philadelphia.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The big sign read "PX," but it  wasn't big enough to hide an  older sign underneath that said  "Macy's." I looked it over from  across the street.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Somebody had organized it  pretty well. I had to admire them.  I mean I don't like New York &mdash; wouldn't  live there if you gave me  the place &mdash; but it showed a sort of  go-getting spirit. It was no easy  job getting a full staff together to  run a department store operation,  when any city the size of New  York must have a couple thousand  stores. You know what I mean?  It's like running a hotel or anything  else &mdash; how are you going to  get people to work for you when  they can just as easily walk down  the street, find a vacant store and  set up their own operation?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        But Macy's was fully manned.  There was a guard at every door  and a walking patrol along the  block-front between the entrances  to make sure nobody broke in  through the windows. They all  wore green armbands and uniforms &mdash; well,  lots of people wore  uniforms.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I walked over.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Afternoon," I said affably to the  guard. "I want to pick up some  stuff. Typewriter, maybe a gun,  you know. How do you work it  here? Flat rate for all you can  carry, prices marked on everything,  or what is it?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He stared at me suspiciously.  He was a monster; six inches taller  than I, he must have weighed two  hundred and fifty pounds. He  didn't look very smart, which  might explain why he was working  for somebody else these days. But  he was smart enough for what he  had to do.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He demanded: "You new in  town?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I nodded.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He thought for a minute. "All  right, buddy. Go on in. You pick  out what you want, see? We'll  straighten out the price when you  come out."</p></div>

			<div class="pagers" id="5"><a href="KnigArth916.shtml.html#4"><b>&lt;</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="KnigArth916.shtml.html#5">5</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="KnigArth916.shtml.html#6"><b>&gt;</b></a></div>
			
			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Fair enough." I started past  him.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He grabbed me by the arm. "No  tricks," he ordered. "You come  out the same door you went in,  understand?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Sure," I said, "if that's the way  you want it."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        That figured &mdash; one way or another:  either they got a commission,  or, like everybody else, they  lived on what they could knock  down. I filed that for further consideration.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Inside, the store smelled pretty  bad. It wasn't just rot, though there  was plenty of that; it was musty  and stale and old. It was dark, or  nearly. About one light in twenty  was turned on, in order to conserve  power. Naturally the escalators  and so on weren't running  at all.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I passed a counter with pencils  and ball-point pens in a  case. Most of them were gone &mdash; somebody  hadn't bothered to go  around in back and had simply  knocked the glass out &mdash; but I found  one that worked and an old order  pad to write on. Over by the  elevators there was a store directory,  so I went over and checked  it, making a list of the departments  worth visiting.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Office Supplies would be the  typewriter. Garden &amp; Home was a  good bet &mdash; maybe I could find a  little wheelbarrow to save carrying  the typewriter in my arms.  What I wanted was one of the  big ones where all the keys are  solenoid-operated instead of the  cam-and-roller arrangement &mdash; that  was all Arthur could operate. And  those things were heavy, as I  knew. That was why we had  ditched the old one in the Bronx.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Sporting Goods &mdash; that would be  for a gun, if there were any left.  Naturally, they were about the  first to go after it happened, when  <i>everybody</i> wanted a gun. I mean  everybody who lived through it.  I thought about clothes &mdash; it was  pretty hot in New York &mdash; and  decided I might as well take a  look.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Typewriter, clothes, gun, wheelbarrow.  I made one more note on  the pad &mdash; try the tobacco counter,  but I didn't have much hope for  that. They had used cigarettes for  currency around this area for a  while, until they got enough bank  vaults open to supply big bills. It  made cigarettes scarce.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I turned away and noticed for  the first time that one of the elevators  was stopped on the main floor.  The doors were closed, but they  were glass doors, and although  there wasn't any light inside, I  could see the elevator was full.  There must have been thirty or  forty people in the car when it  happened.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I'd been thinking that, if nothing  else, these New Yorkers were  pretty neat &mdash; I mean if you don't  count the Bronx. But here were  thirty or forty skeletons that nobody  had even bothered to clear  away.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        You call that neat? Right in  plain view on the ground floor,  where everybody who came into  the place would be sure to go &mdash; I  mean if it had been on one of  the upper floors, what difference  would it have made?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I began to wish we were out  of the city. But naturally that  would have to wait until we  finished what we came here to do &mdash; otherwise,  what was the point  of coming all the way here in the  first place?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The tobacco counter was bare.  I got the wheelbarrow easily  enough &mdash; there were plenty of those,  all sizes; I picked out a nice light  red-and-yellow one with rubber-tired  wheel. I rolled it over to  Sporting Goods on the same floor,  but that didn't work out too well.  I found a 30-30 with telescopic  sights, only there weren't any cartridges  to fit it &mdash; or anything else. I  took the gun anyway; Engdahl  would probably have some extra  ammunition.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Men's Clothing was a waste of  time, too &mdash; I guess these New  Yorkers were too lazy to do  laundry. But I found the typewriter  I wanted.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I put the whole load into the  wheelbarrow, along with a couple  of odds and ends that caught my  eye as I passed through Housewares,  and I bumped as gently as  I could down the shallow steps  of the motionless escalator to the  ground floor.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I came down the back way,  and that was a mistake. It led me  right past the food department.  Well, I don't have to tell you what  <i>that</i> was like, with all the exploded  cans and the rats as big as poodles.  But I found some cologne and  soaked a handkerchief in it, and  with that over my nose, and some  fast footwork for the rats, I managed  to get to one of the doors.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        It wasn't the one I had come  in, but that was all right. I sized  up the guard. He looked smart  enough for a little bargaining, but  not too smart; and if I didn't like  his price, I could always remember  that I was supposed to go out  the other door.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I said: "Psst!"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        When he turned around, I said  rapidly: "Listen, this isn't the way  I came in, but if you want to do  business, it'll be the way I come  out."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He thought for a second, and  then he smiled craftily and said:  "All right, come on."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Well, we haggled. The gun was  the big thing &mdash; he wanted five  thousand for that and he wouldn't  come down. The wheelbarrow he  was willing to let go for five hundred.  And the typewriter &mdash; he  scowled at the typewriter as  though it were contagious.</p></div>

I shrugged.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Well &mdash; " he scratched his head &mdash; "a  thousand?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I shook my head.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Five hundred?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I kept on shaking.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "All right, all right," he grumbled.  "Look, you take the other  things for six thousand &mdash; including  what you got in your pockets that  you don't think I know about,  see? And I'll throw this in. How  about it?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        That was fine as far as I was  concerned, but just on principle  I pushed him a little further. "Forget  it," I said. "I'll give you fifty  bills for the lot, take it or leave  it. Otherwise I'll walk right down  the street to Gimbel's and &mdash; "</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He guffawed.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Whats the matter?" I demanded.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Pal," he said, "you kill me.  Stranger in town, hey? You can't  go anyplace but here."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Why not?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Account of there <i>ain't</i> anyplace  else. See, the chief here don't like  competition. So we don't have to  worry about anybody taking their  trade elsewhere, like &mdash; we burned  all the other places down."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        That explained a couple of  things. I counted out the money,  loaded the stuff back in the wheelbarrow  and headed for the Statler;  but all the time I was counting  and loading, I was talking to  Big Brainless; and by the time I  was actually on the way, I knew  a little more about this "chief."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And that was kind of important,  because he was the man we were  going to have to know very well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class='section_break'>II</p><p>I locked the door of the hotel  room. Arthur was peeping out  of the suitcase at me.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I said: "I'm back. I got your  typewriter." He waved his eye at  me.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I took out the little kit of electricians'  tools I carried, tipped the  typewriter on its back and began  sorting out leads. I cut them free  from the keyboard, soldered on a  ground wire, and began taping the  leads to the strands of a yard of  forty-ply multiplex cable.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        It was a slow and dull job. I  didn't have to worry about which  solenoid lead went to which  strand &mdash; Arthur could sort them  out. But all the same it took an  hour, pretty near, and I was getting  hungry by the time I got the  last connection taped. I shifted the  typewriter so that both Arthur and  I could see it, rolled in a sheet of  paper and hooked the cable to  Arthur's receptors.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Nothing happened.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Oh," I said. "Excuse me,  Arthur. I forgot to plug it in."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I found a wall socket. The typewriter  began to hum and then it  started to rattle and type:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        DURA AUK UKOO RQK  MWS AQB</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        It stopped.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Come on, Arthur," I ordered  impatiently. "Sort them out, will  you?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Laboriously it typed:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        !!!</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Then, for a time, there was a  clacking and thumping as he typed  random letters, peeping out of the  suitcase to see what he had typed,  until the sheet I had put in was  used up.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I replaced it and waited, as patiently  as I could, smoking one of  the last of my cigarettes. After fifteen  minutes or so, he had the hang  of it pretty well. He typed:</p></div>

"Use your  head, will you? I couldn't carry  that old typewriter of yours all  the way down through the Bronx.  It was getting pretty beat-up. Anyway,  I've only got two hands &mdash; "</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        YOU LOUSE, it rattled, ARE  YOU TRYONXXX TRYING  TO INSULT ME BECAUSE I  DONT HAVE ANY Q Q</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Arthur!" I said, shocked. "You  know better than that!"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The typewriter slammed its  carriage back and forth ferociously  a couple of times. Then he said:  ALL RIGHT SAM YOU KNOW  YOUVE GOT ME BY THE  THROAT SO YOU CAN DO  ANYTHING YOU WANT TO  WITH ME WHO CARES  ABOUT MY FEELINGS ANYHOW</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Please don't take that attitude,"  I coaxed.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        WELL</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Please?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He capitulated.

I  might as well. That was the trouble  with getting Arthur a new typewriter  after a couple of days without  one &mdash; he had so much garrulity  stored up in his little brain, and  the only person to spill it on was  me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Apparently I fell asleep.  Well, I mean I must have, because  I woke up. I had been  dreaming I was on guard post outside  the Yard at Portsmouth, and  it was night, and I looked up and  there was something up there, all  silvery and bad. It was a missile &mdash; and  that was silly, because you  never see a missile. But this was  a dream.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And the thing burst, like a  Roman candle flaring out, all sorts  of comet-trails of light, and then  the whole sky was full of bright  and colored snow. Little tiny flakes  of light coming down, a mist of  light, radiation dropping like dew;  and it was so pretty, and I took  a deep breath. And my lungs  burned out like slow fire, and I  coughed myself to death with the  explosions of the missile banging  against my flaming ears….</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Well, it was a dream. It probably  wasn't like that at all &mdash; and if  it had been, I wasn't there to see  it, because I was tucked away safe  under a hundred and twenty  fathoms of Atlantic water. All of  us were on the <i>Sea Sprite</i>.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        But it was a bad dream and it  bothered me, even when I woke up  and found that the banging explosions  of the missile were the  noise of Arthur's typewriter carriage  crashing furiously back and  forth.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He peeped out of the suitcase  and saw that I was awake. He demanded:  HOW CAN YOU FALL  ASLEEP WHEN WERE IN A  PLACE LIKE THIS Q Q ANYTHING  COULD HAPPEN  SAM I KNOW YOU DONT  CARE WHAT HAPPENS TO  ME BUT FOR YOUR OWN  SAKE YOU SHOULDNT</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Oh, dry up," I said.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Being awake, I remembered  that I was hungry. There was still  no sign of Engdahl or the others,  but that wasn't too surprising &mdash; they  hadn't known exactly when  we would arrive. I wished I had  thought to bring some food back  to the room. It looked like long  waiting and I wouldn't want to  leave Arthur alone again &mdash; after all,  he was partly right.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I thought of the telephone.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        On the off-chance that it might  work, I picked it up. Amazing, a  voice from the desk answered.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I crossed my fingers and said:  "Room service?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And the voice answered amiably  enough: "Hold on, buddy. I'll see  if they answer."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Clicking and a good long wait.  Then a new voice said: "Whaddya  want?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        There was no sense pressing my  luck by asking for anything like  a complete meal. I would be lucky  if I got a sandwich.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I said: "Please, may I have a  Spam sandwich on Rye Krisp and  some coffee for Room Fifteen Forty-one?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Please, you go to hell!" the  voice snarled. "What do you think  this is, some damn delicatessen?  You want liquor, we'll get you  liquor. That's what room service  is for!"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I hung up. What was the use  of arguing? Arthur was clacking  peevishly:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        WHATS THE MATTER  SAM YOU THINKING OF  YOUR BELLY AGAIN Q Q</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "You would be if you &mdash; " I  started, and then I stopped.  Arthur's feelings were delicate  enough already. I mean suppose  that all you had left of what you  were born with was a brain in a  kind of sardine can, wouldn't you  be sensitive? Well, Arthur was  more sensitive than you would be,  believe me. Of course, it was his  own foolish fault &mdash; I mean you  don't get a prosthetic tank unless  you die by accident, or something  like that, because if it's disease  they usually can't save even the  brain.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The phone rang again.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        It was the desk clerk. "Say, did  you get what you wanted?" he  asked chummily.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "No."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Oh. Too bad," he said, but  cheerfully. "Listen, buddy, I forgot  to tell you before. That Miss  Engdahl you were expecting, she's  on her way up."</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I dropped the phone onto the  cradle.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Arthur!" I yelled. "Keep quiet  for a while &mdash; trouble!"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He clacked once, and the typewriter  shut itself off. I jumped  for the door of the bathroom, cursing  the fact that I didn't have  cartridges for the gun. Still, empty  or not, it would have to do.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I ducked behind the bathroom  door, in the shadows, covering the  hall door. Because there were two  things wrong with what the desk  clerk had told me. Vern Engdahl  wasn't a "miss," to begin with;  and whatever name he used when  he came to call on me, it wouldn't  be Vern Engdahl.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        There was a knock on the door.  I called: "Come in!"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The door opened and the girl  who called herself Vern Engdahl  came in slowly, looking around. I  stayed quiet and out of sight until  she was all the way in. She didn't  seem to be armed; there wasn't  anyone with her.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I stepped out, holding the gun  on her. Her eyes opened wide and  she seemed about to turn.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Hold it! Come on in, you. Close  the door!"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        She did. She looked as though  she were expecting me. I looked  her over &mdash; medium pretty, not very  tall, not very plump, not very old.  I'd have guessed twenty or so, but  that's not my line of work; she  could have been almost any age  from seventeen on.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The typewriter switched itself  on and began to pound agitatedly.  I crossed over toward her and  paused to peer at what Arthur was  yacking about: SEARCH HER  YOU DAMN FOOL MAYBE  SHES GOT A GUN</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I ordered: "Shut up, Arthur.  I'm <i>going</i> to search her. You! Turn  around!"</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>She shrugged and turned  around, her hands in the air.  Over her shoulder, she said:  "You're taking this all wrong, Sam.  I came here to make a deal with  you."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Sure you did."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        But her knowing my name was  a blow, too. I mean what was the  use of all that sneaking around if  people in New York were going to  know we were here?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I walked up close behind her  and patted what there was to pat.  There didn't seem to be a gun.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "You tickle," she complained.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I took her pocketbook away  from her and went through it. No  gun. A lot of money &mdash; an <i>awful</i>  lot of money. I mean there must  have been two or three hundred  thousand dollars. There was  nothing with a name on it in the  pocketbook.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        She said: "Can I put my hands  down, Sam?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "In a minute." I thought for a  second and then decided to do it &mdash; you  know, I just couldn't afford to  take chances. I cleared my throat  and ordered: "Take off your  clothes."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Her head jerked around and she  stared at me. "<i>What?</i>"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Take them off. You heard me."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Now wait a minute &mdash; " she began  dangerously.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I said: "Do what I tell you,  hear? How do I know you haven't  got a knife tucked away?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        She clenched her teeth. "Why,  you dirty little man! What do you  think &mdash; " Then she shrugged. She  looked at me with contempt and  said: "All right. What's the difference?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Well, there was a considerable  difference. She began to unzip and  unbutton and wriggle, and pretty  soon she was standing there in her  underwear, looking at me as  though I were a two-headed worm.  It was interesting, but kind of embarrassing.  I could see Arthur's  eye-stalk waving excitedly out of  the opened suitcase.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I picked up her skirt and blouse  and shook them. I could feel myself  blushing, and there didn't seem  to be anything in them.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I growled: "Okay, I guess that's  enough. You can put your clothes  back on now."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Gee, thanks," she said.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        She looked at me thoughtfully  and then shook her head as if  she'd never seen anything like me  before and never hoped to again.  Without another word, she began  to get back into her clothes. I had  to admire her poise. I mean she  was perfectly calm about the whole  thing. You'd have thought she was  used to taking her clothes off in  front of strange men.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Well, for that matter, maybe she  was; but it wasn't any of my business.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Arthur was clacking distractedly,  but I didn't pay any  attention to him. I demanded: "All  right, now who are you and what  do you want?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        She pulled up a stocking and  said: "You couldn't have asked  me that in the first place, could  you? I'm Vern Eng &mdash; "</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "<i>Cut it out!</i>"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        She stared at me. "I was only  going to say I'm Vern Engdahl's  partner. We've got a little business  deal cooking and I wanted to talk  to you about this proposition."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Arthur squawked: WHATS  ENGDAHL UP TO NOW Q Q  SAM IM WARNING YOU I  DONT LIKE THE LOOK OF  THIS THIS WOMAN AND  ENGDAHL ARE PROBABLY  DOUBLECROSSING US</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I said: "All right, Arthur, relax.  I'm taking care of things. Now  start over, you. What's your  name?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        She finished putting on her shoe  and stood up. "Amy."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Last name?"</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        She shrugged and fished in her  purse for a cigarette. "What does  it matter? Mind if I sit down?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Go ahead," I rumbled. "But  don't stop talking!"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Oh," she said, "we've got plenty  of time to straighten things out."  She lit the cigarette and walked  over to the chair by the window.  On the way, she gave the luggage  a good long look.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Arthur's eyestalk cowered back  into the suitcase as she came close.  She winked at me, grinned, bent  down and peered inside.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "My," she said, "he's a nice  shiny one, isn't he?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The typewriter began to clatter  frantically. I didn't even bother to  look; I told him: "Arthur, if you  can't keep quiet, you have to expect  people to know you're there."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        She sat down and crossed her  legs. "Now then," she said. "Frankly,  he's what I came to see you  about. Vern told me you had a  pross. I want to buy it."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The typewriter thrashed its carriage  back and forth furiously.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Arthur isn't for sale."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "No?" She leaned back. "Vern's  already sold me his interest, you  know. And you don't really have  any choice. You see, I'm in charge  of materiel procurement for the  Major. If you want to sell your  share, fine. If you don't, why, we  requisition it anyhow. Do you follow?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I was getting irritated &mdash; at  Vern Engdahl, for whatever the  hell he thought he was doing; but  at her because she was handy. I  shook my head.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Fifty thousand dollars? I mean  for your interest?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "No."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Seventy-five?"</p></div>

A hundred  thousand?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        It wasn't going to make any impression  on her, but I tried to explain:  "Arthur's a friend of mine.  He isn't for sale."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She shook her head. "What's  the matter with you? Engdahl  wasn't like this. He sold his interest  for forty thousand and was  glad to get it."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Clatter-clatter-clatter from Arthur.  I didn't blame him for having  hurt feelings that time.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Amy said in a discouraged tone:  "Why can't people be reasonable?  The Major doesn't like it when  people aren't reasonable."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I lowered the gun and cleared  my throat. "He doesn't?" I asked,  cuing her. I wanted to hear more  about this Major, who seemed to  have the city pretty well under his  thumb.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "No, he doesn't." She shook her  head sorrowfully. She said in an  accusing voice: "You out-of-towners  don't know what it's like to  try to run a city the size of New  York. There are fifteen thousand  people here, do you know that? It  isn't one of your hick towns. And  it's worry, worry, worry all the  time, trying to keep things going."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I bet," I said sympathetically.  "You're, uh, pretty close to the  Major?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        She said stiffly: "I'm not married  to him, if that's what you  mean. Though I've had my  chances…. But you see how  it is. Fifteen thousand people to  run a place the size of New York!  It's forty men to operate the power  station, and twenty-five on the  PX, and thirty on the hotel here.  And then there are the local groceries,  and the Army, and the  Coast Guard, and the Air Force &mdash; though,  really, that's only two men &mdash; and &mdash; Well,  you get the picture."</p></div>

"A guy."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I mean what does he like?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Women, mostly," she said, her  expression clouded. "Come on now.  What about it?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I stalled. "What do you want  Arthur for?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        She gave me a disgusted look.  "What do you think? To relieve  the manpower shortage, naturally.  There's more work than there are  men. Now if the Major could just  get hold of a couple of prosthetics,  like this thing here, why, he could  put them in the big installations.  This one used to be an engineer  or something, Vern said."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Well … <i>like</i> an engineer."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Amy shrugged. "So why couldn't  we connect him up with  the power station? It's been done.  The Major knows that &mdash; he was in  the Pentagon when they switched  all the aircraft warning net over  from computer to prosthetic control.  So why couldn't we do the  same thing with our power station  and release forty men for other assignments?  This thing could work  day, night, Sundays &mdash; what's the  difference when you're just a brain  in a sardine can?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Clatter-rattle-<i>bang</i>.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        She looked startled. "Oh. I forgot  he was listening."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "No deal," I said.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        She said: "A hundred and fifty  thousand?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        A hundred and fifty thousand  dollars. I considered that for a  while. Arthur clattered warningly.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Well," I temporized, "I'd have  to be sure he was getting into good  hands &mdash; "</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The typewriter thrashed wildly.  The sheet of paper fluttered out  of the carriage. He'd used it up.  Automatically I picked it up &mdash; it  was covered with imprecations,  self-pity and threats &mdash; and started  to put a new one in.</p></div>

We were all from the  <i>Sea Sprite</i>, of course &mdash; me and  Vern and even Arthur. The thing  about Vern is that he was the lowest-ranking  one of us all &mdash; only an  electricians' mate third, I mean  when anybody paid any attention  to things like that &mdash; and yet he was  pretty much doing the thinking  for the rest of us. Coming to New  York was his idea &mdash; he told us that  was the only place we could get  what we wanted.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Well, as long as we were carrying  Arthur along with us, we pretty  much needed Vern, because he  was the one who knew how to  keep the lash-up going. You've got  no idea what kind of pumps and  plumbing go into a prosthetic tank  until you've seen one opened up.  And, naturally, Arthur didn't want  any breakdowns without somebody  around to fix things up.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The <i>Sea Sprite</i>, maybe you  know, was one of the old liquid-sodium-reactor  subs &mdash; too slow for  combat duty, but as big as a barn,  so they made it a hospital ship. We  were cruising deep when the missiles  hit, and, of course, when we  came up, there wasn't much for a  hospital ship to do. I mean there  isn't any sense fooling around with  anybody who's taken a good deep  breath of fallout.</p></div>

And there wasn't anything  much to do except pay off the  crew and let them go. But us  three stuck together. Why not?  It wasn't as if we had any families  to go back to any more.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Vern just loved all this stuff &mdash; he'd  been an Eagle Scout; maybe  that had something to do with it &mdash; and  he showed us how to boil  drinking water and forage in the  woods and all like that, because  nobody in his right mind wanted  to go near any kind of a town,  until the cold weather set in, anyway.  And it was always Vern,  Vern, telling us what to do, ironing  out our troubles.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        It worked out, except that there  was this one thing. Vern had bright  ideas. But he didn't always tell us  what they were.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        So I wasn't so very surprised  when I came to. I mean there I  was, tied up, with this girl Amy  standing over me, holding the gun  like a club. Evidently she'd found  out that there weren't any cartridges.  And in a couple of minutes  there was a knock on the door,  and she yelled, "Come in," and in  came Vern. And the man who was  with him had to be somebody important,  because there were eight  or ten other men crowding in close  behind.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I didn't need to look at the oak  leaves on his shoulders to realize  that here was the chief, the fellow  who ran this town, the Major.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        It was just the kind of thing  Vern <i>would</i> do.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Vern said, with the look on his  face that made strange officers  wonder why this poor persecuted  man had been forced to spend so  much time in the brig: "Now,  Major, I'm sure we can straighten  all this out.

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The Major teetered on his heels,  thinking. He was a tall, youngish-bald  type, with a long, worried,  horselike face. He said: "Ah, do  you think we should?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I guarantee there'll be no  trouble, Major," Vern promised.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The Major pulled at his little  mustache. "Very well," he said.  "Amy, you come along."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "We'll be right here, Major,"  Vern said reassuringly, escorting  him to the door.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "You bet you will," said the  Major, and tittered. "Ah, bring  that gun along with you, Amy.  And be sure this man knows that  we have bullets."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        They closed the door. Arthur  had been cowering in his suitcase,  but now his eyestalk peeped out  and the rattling and clattering  from that typewriter sounded like  the Battle of the Bulge.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I demanded: "Come on, Vern.  What's this all about?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Vern said: "How much did they  offer you?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Clatter-bang-BANG. I peeked,  and Arthur was saying: WARNED  YOU SAM THAT ENGDAHL  WAS UP TO TRICKS PLEASE  SAM PLEASE PLEASE  PLEASE HIT HIM ON THE  HEAD KNOCK HIM OUT HE  MUST HAVE A GUN SO GET  IT AND SHOOT OUR WAY  OUT OF HERE</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "A hundred and fifty thousand  dollars," I said.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Vern looked outraged. "I only  got forty!"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Arthur clattered: VERN I APPEAL  TO YOUR COMMON  DECENCY WERE OLD SHIPMATES  VERN REMEMBER  ALL THE TIMES I</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Still," Vern mused, "it's all  common funds anyway, right?  Arthur belongs to both of us."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I DONT DONT DONT REPEAT  DONT BELONG TO  ANYBODY BUT ME</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "That's true," I said grudgingly.

"They've got us surrounded."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        ME TO THESE RATS Q Q  SAM VERN PLEASE DONT  SCARE ME</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I said, pointing to the fluttering  paper in the rattling machine:  "You're worrying our friend."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Vern shrugged impatiently.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I KNEW I SHOULDNT  HAVE TRUSTED YOU, Arthur  wept.  THATS ALL I MEAN TO  YOU EH</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Vern said: "Well, Sam? Let's  take the cash and get this thing  over with. After all, he <i>will</i> have  the best of treatment."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        It was a little like selling your  sister into white slavery, but what  else was there to do? Besides, I  kind of trusted Vern.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "All right," I said.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        What Arthur said nearly  scorched the paper.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Vern helped pack Arthur up  for moving. I mean it was just  a matter of pulling the plugs out  and making sure he had a fresh  battery, but Vern wanted to supervise  it himself. Because one of  the little things Vern had up his  sleeve was that he had found a  spot for himself on the Major's  payroll. He was now the official  Prosthetic (Human) Maintenance  Department Chief.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The Major said to me: "Ah,  Dunlap. What sort of experience  have you had?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Experience?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "In the Navy. Your friend Engdahl  suggested you might want to  join us here."</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Oh. I see what you mean." I  shook my head. "Nothing that  would do you any good, I'm afraid.  I was a yeoman."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Yeoman?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Like a company clerk," I explained.  "I mean I kept records  and cut orders and made out reports  and all like that."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Company clerk!" The eyes in  the long horsy face gleamed. "Ah,  you're mistaken, Dunlap! Why,  that's <i>just</i> what we need. Our  morning reports are in foul shape.  Foul! Come over to HQ. Lieutenant  Bankhead will give you a  lift."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Lieutenant Bankhead?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I got an elbow in my ribs for  that. It was that girl Amy, standing  alongside me. "I," she said,  "am Lieutenant Bankhead."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Well, I went along with her,  leaving Engdahl and Arthur behind.  But I must admit I wasn't  sure of my reception.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Out in front of the hotel was a  whole fleet of cars &mdash; three or four  of them, at least. There was a big  old Cadillac that looked like a  gangsters' car &mdash; thick glass in the  windows, tires that looked like  they belonged on a truck. I was  willing to bet it was bulletproof  and also that it belonged to the  Major. I was right both times.  There was a little MG with the  top down, and a couple of light  trucks. Every one of them was  painted bright orange, and every  one of them had the star-and-bar  of the good old United States  Army on its side.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        It took me back to old times &mdash; all  but the unmilitary color. Amy  led me to the MG and pointed.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Sit," she said.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I sat. She got in the other side  and we were off.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        It was a little uncomfortable on  account of I wasn't just sure  whether I ought to apologize for  making her take her clothes off.  And then she tramped on the gas  of that little car and I didn't think  much about being embarrassed or  about her black lace lingerie. I was  only thinking about one thing &mdash; how  to stay alive long enough to  get out of that car.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class='section_break'>IV</p><p>See, what we really wanted was  an ocean liner.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The rest of us probably would  have been happy enough to stay  in Lehigh County, but Arthur was  getting restless.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He was a terrible responsibility,  in a way. I suppose there were a  hundred thousand people or so  left in the country, and not more  than forty or fifty of them were  like Arthur &mdash; I mean if you want  to call a man in a prosthetic tank  a "person." But we all did. We'd  got pretty used to him. We'd  shipped together in the war &mdash; and  survived together, as a few of the  actual fighters did, those who were  lucky enough to be underwater or  high in the air when the ICBMs  landed &mdash; and as few civilians did.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I mean there wasn't much  chance for surviving, for anybody  who happened to be breathing the  open air when it happened. I mean  you can do just so much about  making a "clean" H-bomb, and  if you cut out the long-life fission  products, the short-life ones get  pretty deadly.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Anyway, there wasn't much  damage, except of course that  everybody was dead. All the surface  vessels lost their crews. All  the population of the cities were  gone. And so then, when Arthur  slipped on the gangplank coming  into Newport News and broke his  fool neck, why, we had the whole  staff of the <i>Sea Sprite</i> to work on  him. I mean what else did the  surgeons have to do?</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Of course, that was a long time  ago.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        But we'd stayed together. We  headed for the farm country  around Allentown, Pennsylvania,  because Arthur and Vern Engdahl  claimed to know it pretty  well. I think maybe they had some  hope of finding family or friends,  but naturally there wasn't any of  that. And when you got into the  inland towns, there hadn't been  much of an attempt to clean them  up. At least the big cities and the  ports had been gone over, in some  spots anyway, by burial squads.  Although when we finally decided  to move out and went to Philadelphia &mdash; </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Well, let's be fair; there had  been fighting around there after  the big fight. Anyway, that wasn't  so very uncommon. That was one  of the reasons that for a long time &mdash; four  or five years, at any rate &mdash; we  stayed away from big cities.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        We holed up in a big farmhouse  in Lehigh County. It had its own  generator from a little stream, and  that took care of Arthur's power  needs; and the previous occupants  had been just crazy about stashing  away food. There was enough  to last a century, and that took  care of the two of us. We appreciated  that. We even took the old  folks out and gave them a decent  burial. I mean they'd all been in  the family car, so we just had to  tow it to a gravel pit and push it  in.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The place had its own well, with  an electric pump and a hot-water  system &mdash; oh, it was nice. I was sorry  to leave but, frankly, Arthur  was driving us nuts.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        We never could make the television  work &mdash; maybe there weren't  any stations near enough. But we  pulled in a couple of radio stations  pretty well and Arthur got a big  charge out of listening to them &mdash; see,  he could hear four or five at  a time and I suppose that made  him feel better than the rest of us.</p></div>

			<div class="pagers" id="26"><a href="KnigArth916.shtml.html#25"><b>&lt;</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="KnigArth916.shtml.html#26">26</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="KnigArth916.shtml.html#27"><b>&gt;</b></a></div>
			
			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He heard that the big cities  were cleaned up and every one of  them seemed to want immigrants &mdash; they  were pleading, pleading all  the time, like the TV-set and  vacuum-cleaner people used to in  the old days; they guaranteed  we'd like it if we only came to live  in Philly, or Richmond, or Baltimore,  or wherever. And I guess  Arthur kind of hoped we might  find another pross. And then &mdash; well,  Engdahl came up with this idea  of an ocean liner.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        It figured. I mean you get out  in the middle of the ocean and  what's the difference what it's like  on land? And it especially appealed  to Arthur because he  wanted to do some surface sailing.  He never had when he was real &mdash; I  mean when he had arms and  legs like anybody else. He'd gone  right into the undersea service the  minute he got out of school.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And &mdash; well, sailing was what  Arthur knew something about and  I suppose even a prosthetic man  wants to feel useful. It was like  Amy said: He could be hooked  up to an automated factory &mdash; </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Or to a ship.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>HQ for the Major's Temporary  Military Government &mdash; that's  what the sign said &mdash; was on the  91st floor of the Empire State  Building, and right there that tells  you something about the man. I  mean you know how much power  it takes to run those elevators all  the way up to the top? But the  Major must have liked being able  to look down on everybody else.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Amy Bankhead conducted me  to his office and sat me down to  wait for His Military Excellency  to arrive. She filled me in on him,  to some degree. He'd been an absolute  nothing before the war; but  he had a reserve commission in  the Air Force, and when things  began to look sticky, they'd called  him up and put him in a Missile  Master control point, underground  somewhere up around Ossining.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He was the duty officer when it  happened, and naturally he hadn't  noticed anything like an enemy  aircraft, and naturally the anti-missile  missiles were still rusting  in their racks all around the city;  but since the place had been operating  on sealed ventilation, the  duty complement could stay there  until the short half-life radioisotopes  wore themselves out.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And then the Major found out  that he was not only in charge  of the fourteen men and women of  his division at the center &mdash; he was  ranking United States Military Establishment  officer farther than the  eye could see. So he beat it, fast  as he could, for New York, because  what Army officer doesn't  dream about being stationed in  New York? And he set up his  Temporary Military Government &mdash; and  that was nine years ago.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        If there hadn't been plenty to  go around, I don't suppose he  would have lasted a week &mdash; none  of these city chiefs would have.  But as things were, he was in on  the ground floor, and as newcomers  trickled into the city, his  boys already had things nicely organized.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        It was a soft touch.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Well, we were about a week  getting settled in New York  and things were looking pretty  good. Vern calmed me down by  pointing out that, after all, we had  to sell Arthur, and hadn't we come  out of it plenty okay?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And we had. There was no  doubt about it. Not only did we  have a fat price for Arthur, which  was useful because there were a  lot of things we would have to buy,  but we both had jobs working  for the Major.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Vern was his specialist in the  care and feeding of Arthur and  I was his chief of office routine &mdash; and,  as such, I delighted his fussy  little soul, because by adding what  I remembered of Navy protocol  to what he was able to teach me  of Army routine, we came up with  as snarled a mass of red tape as  any field-grade officer in the whole  history of all armed forces had  been able to accumulate. Oh, I  tell you, nobody sneezed in New  York without a report being made  out in triplicate, with eight endorsements.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Of course there wasn't anybody  to send them to, but that didn't  stop the Major. He said with determination:  "Nobody's ever going  to chew <i>me</i> out for non-compliance  with regulations &mdash; even if I have to invent the regulations myself!"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        We set up in a bachelor apartment  on Central Park South &mdash; the  Major had the penthouse; the  whole building had been converted  to barracks &mdash; and the first chance  we got, Vern snaffled some transportation  and we set out to find  an ocean liner.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        See, the thing was that an ocean  liner isn't easy to steal. I mean  we'd scouted out the lay of the land  before we ever entered the city  itself, and there were plenty of  liners, but there wasn't one that  looked like we could just jump in  and sail it away. For that we  needed an organization. Since we  didn't have one, the best thing to  do was borrow the Major's.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Vern turned up with Amy Bankhead's  MG, and he also turned up  with Amy. I can't say I was displeased,  because I was beginning  to like the girl; but did you ever  try to ride three people in the seats  of an MG? Well, the way to do it  is by having one passenger sit  in the other passenger's lap, which  would have been all right except  that Amy insisted on driving.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        We headed downtown and over  to the West Side. The Major's  Topographical Section &mdash; one former  billboard artist &mdash; had prepared road  maps with little red-ink Xs marking  the streets that were blocked,  which was most of the streets; but  we charted a course that would  take us where we wanted to go.  Thirty-fourth Street was open, and  so was Fifth Avenue all of its  length, so we scooted down Fifth,  crossed over, got under the Elevated  Highway and whined along  uptown toward the Fifties.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "There's one," cried Amy, pointing.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I was on Vern's lap, so I was  making the notes. It was a Fruit  Company combination freighter-passenger  vessel. I looked at Vern,  and Vern shrugged as best he  could, so I wrote it down; but it  wasn't exactly what we wanted.  No, not by a long shot.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Still, the thing to do was to  survey our resources, and then  we could pick the one we liked  best. We went all the way up to  the end of the big-ship docks, and  then turned and came back down,  all the way to the Battery. It  wasn't pleasure driving, exactly &mdash; half  a dozen times we had to get  out the map and detour around  impenetrable jams of stalled and  empty cars &mdash; or anyway, if they  weren't exactly empty, the people  in them were no longer in shape  to get out of our way. But we  made it.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        We counted sixteen ships in  dock that looked as though they  might do for our purposes. We had  to rule out the newer ones and  the reconverted jobs. I mean, after  all, U-235 just lasts so long, and you can steam around the world  on a walnut-shell of it, or whatever  it is, but you can't store it.  So we had to stick with the ships  that were powered with conventional  fuel &mdash; and, on consideration,  only oil at that.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        But that left sixteen, as I say.  Some of them, though, had suffered  visibly from being left untended  for nearly a decade, so that  for our purposes they might as  well have been abandoned in the  middle of the Atlantic; we didn't  have the equipment or ambition  to do any great amount of salvage  work.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The <i>Empress of Britain</i> would  have been a pretty good bet, for  instance, except that it was lying  at pretty nearly a forty-five-degree  angle in its berth. So was the  <i>United States</i>, and so was the  <i>Caronia</i>. The <i>Stockholm</i> was  straight enough, but I took a good  look, and only one tier of portholes  was showing above the water &mdash; evidently  it had settled nice and  even, but it was on the bottom  all the same. Well, that mud  sucks with a fine tight grip, and  we weren't going to try to loosen  it.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        All in all, eleven of the sixteen  ships were out of commission just  from what we could see driving  by.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Vern and I looked at each other.  We stood by the MG, while Amy  sprawled her legs over the side  and waited for us to make up our  minds.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Not good, Sam," said Vern,  looking worried.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I said: "Well, that still leaves  five. There's the <i>Vulcania</i>, the  <i>Cristobal</i> &mdash; "</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Too small."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "All right. The <i>Manhattan</i>, the  <i>Libert&eacute;</i> and the <i>Queen Elizabeth</i>."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Amy looked up, her eyes  gleaming. "Where's the question?"  she demanded. "Naturally, it's the  <i>Queen</i>."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I tried to explain. "Please, Amy.  Leave these things to us, will  you?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "But the Major won't settle for  anything but the best!"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The <i>Major</i>?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I glanced at Vern, who  wouldn't meet my eyes. "Well,"  I said, "look at the problems, Amy.  First we have to check it over.  Maybe it's been burned out &mdash; how  do we know? Maybe the channel  isn't even deep enough to float it  any more &mdash; how do we know?  Where are we going to get the oil  for it?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "We'll get the oil," Amy said  cheerfully.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "And what if the channel isn't  deep enough?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "She'll float," Amy promised.  "At high tide, anyway. Even if  the channel hasn't been dredged in  ten years."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I shrugged and gave up. What was the use of arguing?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        We drove back to the <i>Queen  Elizabeth</i> and I had to admit that  there was a certain attraction  about that big old dowager. We  all got out and strolled down the  pier, looking over as much as we  could see.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The pier had never been  cleaned out. It bothered me a little &mdash; I  mean I don't like skeletons  much &mdash; but Amy didn't seem to  mind. The <i>Queen</i> must have just  docked when it happened, because  you could still see bony queues,  as though they were waiting for  customs inspection.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Some of the bags had been  opened and the contents scattered  around &mdash; naturally, somebody was  bound to think of looting the  <i>Queen</i>. But there were as many  that hadn't been touched as that  had been opened, and the whole  thing had the look of an amateur  attempt. And that was all to the  good, because the fewer persons  who had boarded the <i>Queen</i> in the  decade since it happened, the more  chance of our finding it in usable  shape.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Amy saw a gangplank still up,  and with cries of girlish glee ran  aboard.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I plucked at Vern's sleeve.  "You," I said. "What's this about  what the <i>Major</i> won't settle for  less than?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He said: "Aw, Sam, I had to  tell her something, didn't I?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "But what about the Major &mdash; "</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He said patiently: "You don't  understand. It's all part of my  plan, see? The Major is the big  thing here and he's got a birthday  coming up next month. Well, the  way I put it to Amy, we'll fix  him up with a yacht as a birthday  present, see? And, of course, when  it's all fixed up and ready to lift  anchor &mdash; "</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I said doubtfully: "That's the  hard way, Vern. Why couldn't we  just sort of get steam up and take  off?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He shook his head. "<i>That</i> is the  hard way. This way we get all the  help and supplies we need, understand?"</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I shrugged. That was the way  it was, so what was the use of arguing?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        But there was one thing more  on my mind. I said: "How come  Amy's so interested in making  the Major happy?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Vern chortled. "Jealous, eh?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I asked a question!"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Calm down, boy. It's just that  he's in charge of things here so  naturally she wants to keep in  good with him."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I scowled. "I keep hearing  stories about how the Major's  chief interest in life is women.  You sure she isn't ambitious to be  one of them?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He said: "The reason she wants  to keep him happy is so she <i>won't</i>  be one of them."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class='section_break'>V</p><p>The name of the place was  Bayonne.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Vern said: "One of them's <i>got</i>  to have oil, Sam. It <i>has</i> to."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Sure," I said.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "There's no question about it.  Look, this is where the tankers  came to discharge oil. They'd come  in here, pump the oil into the refinery  tanks and &mdash; "</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Vern," I said. "Let's look, shall  we?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He shrugged, and we hopped off  the little outboard motorboat onto  a landing stage. The tankers  towered over us, rusty and screeching  as the waves rubbed them  against each other.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        There were fifty of them there  at least, and we poked around  them for hours. The hatches were  rusted shut and unmanageable,  but you could tell a lot by sniffing.  Gasoline odor was out; smell  of seaweed and dead fish was out;  but the heavy, rank smell of fuel  oil, that was what we were sniffing  for. Crews had been aboard  these ships when the missiles  came, and crews were still aboard.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Beyond the two-part superstructures  of the tankers, the skyline  of New York was visible. I  looked up, sweating, and saw the  Empire State Building and  imagined Amy up there, looking  out toward us.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        She knew we were here. It was  her idea. She had scrounged up a  naval engineer, or what she called  a naval engineer &mdash; he had once been  a stoker on a ferryboat. But he  claimed he knew what he was  talking about when he said the  only thing the <i>Queen</i> needed to  make 'er go was oil. And so we  left him aboard to tinker and  polish, with a couple of helpers  Amy detached from the police  force, and we tackled the oil  problem.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Which meant Bayonne. Which  was where we were.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        It had to be a tanker with at  least a fair portion of its cargo  intact, because the <i>Queen</i> was a  thirsty creature, drinking fuel not  by the shot or gallon but by the  ton.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Saaam! Sam <i>Dunlap</i>!"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I looked up, startled. Five ships  away, across the U of the mooring,  Vern Engdahl was bellowing  at me through cupped hands.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I found it!" he shouted. "Oil,  lots of oil! Come look!"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I clasped my hands over my  head and looked around. It was a  long way around to the tanker  Vern was on, hopping from deck  to deck, detouring around open  stretches.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I shouted: "I'll get the boat!"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He waved and climbed up on  the rail of the ship, his feet dangling  over, looking supremely happy  and pleased with himself. He  lit a cigarette, leaned back against  the upward sweep of the rail and  waited.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        It took me a little time to get  back to the boat and a little more  time than that to get the damn  motor started. Vern! "Let's not  take that lousy little twelve horse-power,  Sam," he'd said reasonably.  "The twenty-five's more what  we need!" And maybe it was, but  none of the motors had been  started in most of a decade, and  the twenty-five was just that much  harder to start now.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I struggled over it, swearing,  for twenty minutes or more.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The tanker by whose side we  had tied up began to swing toward  me as the tide changed to outgoing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For a moment there, I was  counting seconds, expecting to  have to make a jump for it before  the big red steel flank squeezed  the little outboard flat against the  piles.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        But I got it started &mdash; just about  in time. I squeezed out of the trap  with not much more than a yard  to spare and threaded my way  into open water.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        There was a large, threatening  sound, like an enormous slow  cough.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I rounded the stern of the last  tanker between me and open  water, and looked into the eye of  a fire-breathing dragon.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Vern and his cigarettes! The  tanker was loose and ablaze, bearing  down on me with the slow  drift of the ebbing tide. From the  hatches on the forward deck, two  fountains of fire spurted up and  out, like enormous nostrils spouting  flame. The hawsers had been  burned through, the ship was  adrift, I was in its path &mdash; </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And so was the frantically  splashing figure of Vern Engdahl,  trying desperately to swim out of  the way in the water before it.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        What kept it from blowing up  in our faces I will never know,  unless it was the pressure in the  tanks forcing the flame out; but  it didn't. Not just then. Not until  I had Engdahl aboard and we  were out in the middle of the Hudson,  staring back; and then it  went up all right, all at once, like  a missile or a volcano; and there  had been fifty tankers in that one  mooring, but there weren't any  any more, or not in shape for us  to use.</p></div>

			<div class="pagers" id="35"><a href="KnigArth916.shtml.html#34"><b>&lt;</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="KnigArth916.shtml.html#35">35</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="KnigArth916.shtml.html#36"><b>&gt;</b></a></div>
			
			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I looked at Engdahl.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He said defensively: "Honest,  Sam, I thought it was oil. It  <i>smelled</i> like oil. How was I to  know &mdash; "</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Shut up," I said.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He shrugged, injured. "But it's  all right, Sam. No fooling. There  are plenty of other tankers  around. Plenty. Down toward the  Amboys, maybe moored out in the  channel. There must be. We'll find  them."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "No," I said. "<i>You</i> will."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And that was all I said, because  I am forgiving by nature;  but I thought a great deal more.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Surprisingly, though, he did find  a tanker with a full load, the  very next day.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        It became a question of getting  the tanker to the <i>Queen</i>. I left  that part up to Vern, since he  claimed to be able to handle it.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        It took him two weeks. First  it was finding the tanker, then it  was locating a tug in shape to  move, then it was finding someone  to pilot the tug. Then it was  waiting for a clear and windless  day &mdash; because the pilot he found  had got all his experience sailing  Star boats on Long Island Sound &mdash; and  then it was easing the tanker  out of Newark Bay, into the channel,  down to the pier in the North  River &mdash; </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Oh, it was work and no fooling.  I enjoyed it very much, because  I didn't have to do it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But I had enough to keep  me busy at that. I found a  man who claimed he used to be  a radio engineer. And if he was an  engineer, I was Albert Einstein's  mother, but at least he knew which  end of a soldering iron was hot.  There was no need for any great  skill, since there weren't going to  be very many vessels to communicate  with.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Things began to move.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The advantage of a ship like  the <i>Queen</i>, for our purposes, was  that the thing was pretty well automated  to start out with. I mean  never mind what the seafaring  unions required in the way of  flesh-and-blood personnel. What it  came down to was that one man in  the bridge or wheelhouse could  pretty well make any part of the  ship go or not go.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The engine-room telegraph  wasn't hooked up to control the  engines, no. But the wiring diagram  needed only a few little  changes to get the same effect,  because where in the original concept  a human being would take a  look at the repeater down in the  engine room, nod wisely, and push  a button that would make the  engines stop, start, or whatever &mdash; why,  all we had to do was cut  out the middleman, so to speak.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Our genius of the soldering iron  replaced flesh and blood with some  wiring and, presto, we had centralized  engine control.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The steering was even easier.  Steering was a matter of electronic  control and servomotors to begin  with. Windjammers in the old  movies might have a man lashed  to the wheel whose muscle power  turned the rudder, but, believe me,  a big superliner doesn't. The rudders  weigh as much as any old  windjammer ever did from stem  to stern; you have to have motors  to turn them; and it was only a matter of getting out the old soldering  iron again.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        By the time we were through,  we had every operational facility  of the <i>Queen</i> hooked up to a single  panel on the bridge.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Engdahl showed up with the oil  tanker just about the time we got  the wiring complete. We rigged up  a pump and filled the bunkers till  they were topped off full. We  guessed, out of hope and ignorance,  that there was enough in there to  take us half a dozen times around  the world at normal cruising speed,  and maybe there was. Anyway,  it didn't matter, for surely we had  enough to take us anywhere we  wanted to go, and then there  would be more.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        We crossed our fingers, turned  our ex-ferry-stoker loose, pushed a  button &mdash; </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Smoke came out of the stacks.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The antique screws began to  turn over. Astern, a sort of hump  of muddy water appeared. The  <i>Queen</i> quivered underfoot. The  mooring hawsers creaked and sang.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Turn her off!" screamed Engdahl.  "She's headed for Times  Square!"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Well, that was an exaggeration,  but not much of one; and there  wasn't any sense in stirring up  the bottom mud. I pushed buttons  and the screws stopped. I pushed  another button, and the big engines  quietly shut themselves off,  and in a few moments the stacks  stopped puffing their black smoke.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The ship was alive.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Solemnly Engdahl and I shook  hands. We had the thing licked.  All, that is, except for the one  small problem of Arthur.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The thing about Arthur was  they had put him to work.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        It was in the power station, just  as Amy had said, and Arthur  didn't like it. The fact that he  didn't like it was a splendid reason  for staying away from there, but  I let my kind heart overrule my  good sense and paid him a visit.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        It was way over on the East  Side, miles and miles from any  civilized area. I borrowed Amy's  MG, and borrowed Amy to go  with it, and the two of us packed  a picnic lunch and set out. There  were reports of deer on Avenue  A, so I brought a rifle, but we  never saw one; and if you want  my opinion, those reports were  nothing but wishful thinking. I  mean if people couldn't survive,  how could deer?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        We finally threaded our way  through the clogged streets and  parked in front of the power station.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "There's supposed to be a  guard," Amy said doubtfully.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I looked. I looked pretty carefully,  because if there was a guard,  I wanted to see him. The Major's  orders were that vital defense installations &mdash; such  as the power station,  the PX and his own barracks  building &mdash; were to be guarded  against trespassers on a shoot-on-sight  basis and I wanted to make  sure that the guard knew we were  privileged persons, with passes  signed by the Major's own hand.  But we couldn't find him. So we  walked in through the big door,  peered around, listened for the  sounds of machinery and walked  in that direction.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And then we found him; he was  sound asleep. Amy, looking indignant,  shook him awake.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Is that how you guard military  property?" she scolded. "Don't  you know the penalty for sleeping  at your post?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The guard said something irritable  and unhappy. I got her off  his back with some difficulty, and  we located Arthur.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Picture a shiny four-gallon tomato  can, with the label stripped  off, hanging by wire from the  flashing-light panels of an electric  computer. That was Arthur. The  shiny metal cylinder was his prosthetic  tank; the wires were the  leads that served him for fingers,  ears and mouth; the glittering  panel was the control center for  the Consolidated Edison Eastside  Power Plant No. 1.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Hi, Arthur," I said, and a sudden  ear-splitting thunderous hiss was  his way of telling me that he knew  I was there.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I didn't know exactly what it  was he was trying to say and I  didn't want to; fortune spares me  few painful moments, and I accept  with gratitude the ones it does.  The Major's boys hadn't bothered  to bring Arthur's typewriter along &mdash; I  mean who cares what a generator-governor  had to offer in the  way of conversation? &mdash; so all he  could do was blow off steam from  the distant boilers.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>Well, not quite all. Light  flashed; a bucket conveyor  began crashingly to dump loads of  coal; and an alarm gong began to  pound.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Please, Arthur," I begged.  "Shut up a minute and listen, will  you?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        More lights. The gong rapped  half a dozen times sharply, and  stopped.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I said: "Arthur, you've got to  trust Vern and me. We have this  thing figured out now. We've got  the <i>Queen Elizabeth</i> &mdash; "</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        A shattering hiss of steam &mdash; meaning  delight this time, I  thought. Or anyway hoped.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        " &mdash; and its only a question of  time until we can carry out the  plan. Vern says to apologize for  not looking in on you &mdash; " <i>hiss</i> &mdash; "but  he's been busy. And after all, you  know it's more important to get  everything ready so you can get  out of this place, right?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Psst," said Amy.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        She nodded briefly past my shoulder. I looked, and there was  the guard, looking sleepy and surly  and definitely suspicious.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I said heartily: "So as soon as  I fix it up with the Major, we'll  arrange for something better for  you. Meanwhile, Arthur, you're  doing a capital job and I want you  to know that all of us loyal New  York citizens and public servants  deeply appreciate &mdash; "</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Thundering crashes, bangs,  gongs, hisses, and the scream of a  steam whistle he'd found somewhere.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Arthur was mad.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "So long, Arthur," I said, and  we got out of there &mdash; just barely  in time. At the door, we found that  Arthur had reversed the coal  scoops and a growing mound of  it was pouring into the street where  we'd left the MG parked. We got  the car started just as the heap  was beginning to reach the bumpers,  and at that the paint would  never again be the same.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Oh, yes, he was mad. I could  only hope that in the long run he  would forgive us, since we were  acting for his best interests, after  all.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Anyway, I <i>thought</i> we were.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Still, things worked out pretty  well &mdash; especially between Amy  and me. Engdahl had the theory  that she had been dodging the  Major so long that <i>anybody</i> looked  good to her, which was hardly  flattering. But she and I were  getting along right well.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        She said worriedly: "The only  thing, Sam, is that, frankly, the  Major has just about made up his  mind that he wants to marry me &mdash; "</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "He <i>is</i> married!" I yelped.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Naturally he's married. He's  married to &mdash; so far &mdash; one hundred  and nine women. He's been hitting  off a marriage a month for a good  many years now and, to tell you  the truth, I think he's got the habit  Anyway, he's got his eye on me."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I demanded jealously: "Has he  said anything?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        She picked a sheet of onionskin  paper out of her bag and handed  it to me. It was marked <i>Top  Secret</i>, and it really was, because  it hadn't gone through his regular  office &mdash; I knew that because I was  his regular office. It was only two  lines of text and sloppily typed  at that:</p><p>&nbsp;       <blockquote>   Lt. Amy Bankhead will report   to HQ at 1700 hours 1 July to   carry out orders of the Commanding   Officer.  </blockquote><p>       The first of July was only a  week away. I handed the orders  back to her.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "And the orders of the Commanding  Officer will be &mdash; " I  wanted to know.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        She nodded. "You guessed it."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I said: "We'll have to work  fast."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On the thirtieth of June, we  invited the Major to come  aboard his palatial new yacht.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Ah, thank you," he said gratefully.  "A surprise? For my birthday?  Ah, you loyal members of  my command make up for all that  I've lost &mdash; all of it!" He nearly  wept.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I said: "Sir, the pleasure is all  ours," and backed out of his presence.  What's more, I meant every  word.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        It was a select party of slightly  over a hundred. All of the wives  were there, barring twenty or thirty  who were in disfavor &mdash; still, that  left over eighty. The Major  brought half a dozen of his favorite  officers. His bodyguard and our  crew added up to a total of thirty  men.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        We were set up to feed a hundred  and fifty, and to provide  liquor for twice that many, so it  looked like a nice friendly brawl.  I mean we had our radio operator  handing out highballs as the guests  stepped on board. The Major was  touched and delighted; it was  exactly the kind of party he liked.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He came up the gangplank with  his face one great beaming smile.  "Eat! Drink!" he cried. "Ah, and  be merry!" He stretched out his  hands to Amy, standing by behind  the radio op. "For tomorrow we  wed," he added, and sentimentally  kissed his proposed bride.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I cleared my throat. "How about  inspecting the ship, Major?" I interrupted.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Plenty of time for that, my  boy," he said. "Plenty of time for  that." But he let go of Amy and  looked around him. Well, it was  worth looking at. Those Englishmen  really knew how to build a  luxury liner. God rest them.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The girls began roaming around.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        It was a hot day and late afternoon,  and the girls began discarding  jackets and boleros, and that  began to annoy the Major.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Ah, cover up there!" he ordered  one of his wives. "You too  there, what's-your-name. Put that  blouse back on!"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        It gave him something to think  about. He was a very jealous man,  Amy had said, and when you stop  to think about it, a jealous man  with a hundred and nine wives to  be jealous of really has a job. Anyway,  he was busy watching his  wives and keeping his military  cabinet and his bodyguard busy  too, and that made him too busy  to notice when I tipped the high  sign to Vern and took off.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class='section_break'>VI</p><p>In Consolidated Edison's big  power plant, the guard was  friendly. "I hear the Major's over  on your boat, pal. Big doings. Got  a lot of the girls there, hey?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He bent, sniggering, to look at  my pass.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "That's right, pal," I said, and  slugged him.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Arthur screamed at me with a  shrill blast of steam as I came in.  But only once. I wasn't there for  conversation. I began ripping apart  his comfy little home of steel  braces and copper wires, and it  didn't take much more than a  minute before I had him free. And  that was very fortunate because,  although I had tied up the guard,  I hadn't done it very well, and it  was just about the time I had  Arthur's steel case tucked under  my arm that I heard a yelling and  bellowing from down the stairs.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The guard had got free.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Keep calm, Arthur!" I ordered  sharply. "We'll get out of this,  don't you worry!"</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        But he wasn't worried, or anyway  didn't show it, since he  couldn't. I was the one who was  worried. I was up on the second  floor of the plant, in the control  center, with only one stairway going  down that I knew about, and  that one thoroughly guarded by  a man with a grudge against me.  Me, I had Arthur, and no weapon,  and I hadn't a doubt in the world  that there were other guards  around and that my friend would  have them after me before long.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Problem. I took a deep breath  and swallowed and considered  jumping out the window. But it  wasn't far enough to the ground.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Feet pounded up the stairs,  more than two of them. With  Arthur dragging me down on one  side, I hurried, fast as I could,  along the steel galleries that surrounded  the biggest boiler. It was  a nice choice of alternatives &mdash; if I  stayed quiet, they would find me;  if I ran, they would hear me, and  then find me.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        But ahead there was &mdash; what?  Something. A flight of stairs, it  looked like, going out and, yes, <i>up</i>.  Up? But I was already on the  second floor.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Hey, you!" somebody bellowed  from behind me.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I didn't stop to consider. I ran.  It wasn't steps, not exactly; it was  a chain of coal scoops on a long  derrick arm, a moving bucket arrangement  for unloading fuel from  barges. It did go up, though, and  more important it went <i>out</i>. The  bucket arm was stretched across  the clogged roadway below to a  loading tower that hung over the  water.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        If I could get there, I might  be able to get down. If I could get  down &mdash; yes, I could see it; there  were three or four mahogany  motor launches tied to the foot of  the tower.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And nobody around.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I looked over my shoulder, and  didn't like what I saw, and scuttled  up that chain of enormous  buckets like a roach on a washboard,  one hand for me and one  hand for Arthur.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thank heaven, I had a good  lead on my pursuers &mdash; I needed  it. I was on the bucket chain while  they were still almost a city block  behind me, along the galleries. I  was halfway across the roadway,  afraid to look down, before they  reached the butt end of the chain.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Clash-clatter. <i>Clank!</i> The bucket  under me jerked and clattered and  nearly threw me into the street.  One of those jokers had turned on  the conveyor! It was a good trick,  all right, but not quite in time. I  made a flying jump and I was on  the tower.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I didn't stop to thumb my nose  at them, but I thought of it.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I was down those steel steps,  breathing like a spouting whale,  in a minute flat, and jumping out  across the concrete, coal-smeared  yard toward the moored launches.  Quickly enough, I guess, but with  nothing at all to spare, because although  I hadn't seen anyone  there, there was a guard.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He popped out of a doorway,  blinking foolishly; and overhead  the guards at the conveyor belt  were screaming at him. It took him  a second to figure out what was  going on, and by that time I was  in a launch, cast off the rope,  kicked it free, and fumbled for  the starting button.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        It took me several seconds to  realize that a rope was required,  that in fact there was no button;  and by then I was floating yards  away, but the pudgy pop-eyed  guard was also in a launch, and he  didn't have to fumble. He knew.  He got his motor started a fraction  of a second before me, and  there he was, coming at me, set  to ram. Or so it looked.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I wrenched at the wheel and  brought the boat hard over; but  he swerved too, at the last moment,  and brought up something  that looked a little like a spear  and a little like a sickle and turned  out to be a boathook. I ducked,  just in time. It sizzled over my  head as he swung and crashed  against the windshield. Hunks of  safety glass splashed out over the  forward deck, but better that than  my head.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Boathooks, hey? I had a boathook  too! If he didn't have another  weapon, I was perfectly willing  to play; I'd been sitting and taking  it long enough and I was very  much attracted by the idea of  fighting back. The guard recovered  his balance, swore at me, fought  the wheel around and came back.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        We both curved out toward the  center of the East River in intersecting  arcs. We closed. He  swung first. I ducked &mdash; </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And from a crouch, while he  was off balance, I caught him in  the shoulder with the hook.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He made a mighty splash.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I throttled down the motor long  enough to see that he was still conscious.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Touch&eacute;, buster," I said, and set  course for the return trip down  around the foot of Manhattan,  back toward the <i>Queen</i>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It took a while, but that was  all right; it gave everybody a  nice long time to get plastered. I  sneaked aboard, carrying Arthur,  and turned him over to Vern. Then  I rejoined the Major. He was  making an inspection tour of the  ship &mdash; what he called an inspection,  after his fashion.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He peered into the engine  rooms and said: "Ah, fine."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He stared at the generators that  were turning over and nodded  when I explained we needed them  for power for lights and everything  and said: "Ah, of course."</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He opened a couple of stateroom  doors at random and said:  "Ah, nice."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And he went up on the flying  bridge with me and such of his  officers as still could walk and  said: "Ah."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Then he said in a totally different  tone: "What the devil's the  matter over there?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He was staring east through the  muggy haze. I saw right away  what it was that was bothering him &mdash; easy,  because I knew where to  look. The power plant way over  on the East Side was billowing  smoke.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Where's Vern Engdahl? That  gadget of his isn't working right!"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "You mean Arthur?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I mean that brain in a bottle.  It's Engdahl's responsibility, you  know!"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Vern came up out of the wheelhouse  and cleared his throat.  "Major," he said earnestly, "I  think there's some trouble over  there. Maybe you ought to go  look for yourself."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Trouble?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I, uh, hear there've been power  failures," Vern said lamely. "Don't  you think you ought to inspect it?  I mean just in case there's something  serious?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The Major stared at him  frostily, and then his mood  changed. He took a drink from the  glass in his hand, quickly finishing  it off.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Ah," he said, "hell with it.  Why spoil a good party? If there  are going to be power failures,  why, let them be. That's my  motto!"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Vern and I looked at each other.  He shrugged slightly, meaning,  well, we tried. And I shrugged  slightly, meaning, what did you  expect? And then he glanced upward,  meaning, take a look at  what's there.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        But I didn't really have to look  because I heard what it was. In  fact, I'd been hearing it for some  time. It was the Major's entire air  force &mdash; two helicopters, swirling  around us at an average altitude of  a hundred feet or so. They showed  up bright against the gathering  clouds overhead, and I looked at  them with considerable interest &mdash; partly  because I considered it an  even-money bet that one of them  would be playing crumple-fender  with our stacks, partly because I  had an idea that they were not  there solely for show.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I said to the Major: "Chief,  aren't they coming a little close?  I mean it's <i>your</i> ship and all, but  what if one of them takes a spill  into the bridge while you're here?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        He grinned. "They know better,"  he bragged. "Ah, besides, I want  them close. I mean if anything  went wrong."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I said, in a tone that showed as  much deep hurt as I could  manage: "Sir, what could go  wrong?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Oh, you know." He patted my  shoulder limply. "Ah, no offense?"  he asked.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I shook my head. "Well," I said,  "let's go below."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All of it was done carefully,  carefully as could be. The  only thing was, we forgot about  the typewriters. We got everybody,  or as near as we could, into  the Grand Salon where the food  was, and right there on a table at  the end of the hall was one of the  typewriters clacking away. Vern  had rigged them up with rolls of  paper instead of sheets, and maybe  that was ingenious, but it was  also a headache just then. Because  the typewriter was banging out:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        LEFT FOUR THIRTEEN  FOURTEEN AND TWENTYONE  BOILERS WITH A FULL  HEAD OF STEAM AND THE  SAFETY VALVES LOCKED  BOY I TELL YOU WHEN  THOSE THINGS LET GO  YOURE GOING TO HEAR A  NOISE THATLL KNOCK  YOUR HAT OFF</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The Major inquired politely:  "Something to do with the ship?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Oh, <i>that</i>," said Vern. "Yeah.  Just a little, uh, something to do  with the ship. Say, Major, here's  the bar. Real scotch, see? Look  at the label!"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The Major glanced at him with  faint contempt &mdash; well, he'd had the  pick of the greatest collection of  high-priced liquor stores in the  world for ten years, so no wonder.  But he allowed Vern to press a  drink on him.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And the typewriter kept rattling:</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        LOOKS LIKE RAIN ANY  MINUTE NOW HOO BOY IM  GLAD I WONT BE IN THOSE  WHIRLYBIRDS WHEN THE  STORM STARTS SAY VERN  WHY DONT YOU EVER ANSWER  ME Q Q ISNT IT  ABOUT TIME TO TAKE  OFF XXX I MEAN GET UNDER  WEIGH Q Q</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Some of the "clerks, typists, domestic  personnel and others" &mdash; that  was the way they were listed on  the T/O; it was only coincidence  that the Major had married them  all &mdash; were staring at the typewriter.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Drinks!" Vern called nervously.  "Come on, girls! Drinks!"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Major poured himself a  stiff shot and asked: "What <i>is</i>  that thing? A teletype or something?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "That's right," Vern said, trailing  after him as the Major wandered  over to inspect it.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I GIVE THOSE BOILERS  ABOUT TEN MORE MINUTES  SAM WELL WHAT  ABOUT IT Q Q READY TO  SHOVE OFF Q Q</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The Major said, frowning faintly:  "Ah, that reminds me of something.  Now what is it?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "More scotch?" Vern cried.  "Major, a little more scotch?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The Major ignored him, scowling.  One of the "clerks, typists"  said: "Honey, you know what it  is? It's like that pross you had,  remember? It was on our wedding  night, and you'd just got it, and  you kept asking it to tell you  limericks."</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The Major snapped his fingers.  "Knew I'd get it," he glowed.  Then abruptly he scowled again  and turned to face Vern and me.  "Say &mdash; " he began.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I said weakly: "The boilers."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The Major stared at me, then  glanced out the window. "What  boilers?" he demanded. "It's just  a thunderstorm. Been building up  all day. Now what about this? Is  that thing &mdash; "</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        But Vern was paying him no  attention. "Thunderstorm?" he  yelled. "Arthur, you listening? Are  the helicopters gone?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        YESYESYES</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Then shove off, Arthur! Shove  off!"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The typewriter rattled and  slammed madly.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The Major yelled angrily:  "Now listen to me, you! I'm  asking you a question!"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        But we didn't have to answer,  because there was a thrumming  and a throbbing underfoot, and  then one of the "clerks, typists"  screamed: "The dock!" She  pointed at a porthole. "It's  moving!"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Well, we got out of there &mdash; barely  in time. And then it  was up to Arthur. We had the  whole ship to roam around in  and there were plenty of places  to hide. They had the whole ship  to search. And Arthur was the  whole ship.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Because it was Arthur, all right,  brought in and hooked up by  Vern, attained to his greatest  dream and ambition. He was skipper  of a superliner, and more than  any skipper had ever been &mdash; the  ship was his body, as the prosthetic  tank had never been; the keel his  belly, the screws his feet, the engines  his heart and lungs, and  every moving part that could be  hooked into central control his  many, many hands.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Search for us? They were  lucky they could move at all!  Fire Control washed them with  salt water hoses, directed by Arthur's  brain. Watertight doors,  proof against sinking, locked them  away from us at Arthur's whim.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The big bull whistle overhead  brayed like a clamoring Gabriel,  and the ship's bells tinkled and  clanged. Arthur backed that enormous  ship out of its berth like a  racing scull on the Schuylkill. The  four giant screws lashed the water  into white foam, and then the thin  mud they sucked up into tan; and  the ship backed, swerved, lashed  the water, stopped, and staggered  crazily forward.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Arthur brayed at the Statue of  Liberty, tooted good-by to Staten  Island, feinted a charge at Sandy  Hook and really laid back his ears  and raced once he got to deep water past the moored lightship.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        We were off!</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Well, from there on, it was easy.  We let Arthur have his fun with  the Major and the bodyguards &mdash; and  by the sodden, whimpering  shape they were in when they  came out, it must really have been  fun for him. There were just the  three of us and only Vern and I  had guns &mdash; but Arthur had the  <i>Queen Elizabeth</i>, and that put the  odds on our side.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        We gave the Major a choice:  row back to Coney Island &mdash; we  offered him a boat, free of charge &mdash; or  come along with us as cabin  boy. He cast one dim-eyed look  at the hundred and nine "clerks,  typists" and at Amy, who would  never be the hundred and tenth.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And then he shrugged and,  game loser, said: "Ah, why not?  I'll come along."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And why not, when you come  to think of it? I mean ruling  a city is nice and all that, but a  sea voyage is a refreshing change.  And while a hundred and nine to  one is a respectable female-male  ratio, still it must be wearing; and  eighty to thirty isn't so bad, either.  At least, I guess that was what  was in the Major's mind. I know it  was what was in mine.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And I discovered that it was in  Amy's, for the first thing she did  was to march me over to the typewriter  and say: "You've had it,  Sam. We'll dispose with the wedding  march &mdash; just get your friend  Arthur here to marry us."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Arthur?"</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "The captain," she said. "We're  on the high seas and he's empowered  to perform marriages."</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Vern looked at me and shrugged,  meaning, you asked for this one,  boy. And I looked at him and  shrugged, meaning, it could be  worse.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        And indeed it could. We'd got  our ship; we'd got our ship's company &mdash; because,  naturally, there  wasn't any use stealing a big ship  for just a couple of us. We'd had  to manage to get a sizable colony  aboard. That was the whole idea.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        The world, in fact, was ours. It  could have been very much worse  indeed, even though Arthur was  laughing so hard as he performed  the ceremony that he jammed up  all his keys.</div>
