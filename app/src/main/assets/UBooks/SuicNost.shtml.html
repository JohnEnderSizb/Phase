<div class="story_text" id="1"><p>Guadalupe Chavez moved though our house like a breeze on the Yucatan  Peninsula.   I sat with my ankles crossed, chain-smoking V-slims while  watching her from a leather chair, which stuck to my skin in the heat.  I  think I hated her then.  She vacuumed under my feet, trying not to focus on  the bandages wrapped tightly around my black wrists.  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Suicide.  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Nostalgia.  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        She wants to go back home.  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Guadalupe switched off the vacuum, the silence reminding my ears of  secrets. Of commiserating whispers.  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Suicide?  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        She winds the cord between her palm and her elbow; her brown eyes focused  on the table where a list that my husband left for her sits only half done.   I exhale rings of smoke, wishing that they would wrap around her neck,  tighten like twine and twist around her young, willowy neck.  She leans over  to pick up the list, her breasts pulled forward, looking like golden apples.    I tell myself that her perfume smells of a wet horse, but the truth was  that it left me feeling dizzy.  I watched her hair trail behind her as she swayed from one room to another.  A chocolate wave ...  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Guadalupe.   </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        My husband Sydney says her name like his reoccurring 'Hail Mary's' or like the prayer 'Oracion Al Sagrado corazon De Maria.'  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Oh, Guadalupe, please.  Guadalupe, oh won't you please and por favor?"  I  sit in corners, in shadows, dormant, listening to him purr.  His deep ebony  tone makes me shudder, and I picture his twenty-four Karat eyes, the soft  pink of his palms pressed against her bare shoulder.  Guadalupe never  responds to him with anything but timid roughly spoken yes' and no's. She  ties her apron tighter, she threads misplaced hair back into her bun; she  mops like she's rowing a boat.  </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Guadalupe.</p><p class='section_break'>*</p><p>At night Sydney sips mescal.  He swallows, tightens his face, and then  relaxes.  I know he is comparing it to the Cabernet Sauvignon that we used  to have in our wine cellar when we lived in Manhattan.  We could afford the  best then.  Now he is forced to choke down corn liquor, getting quickly bit  off its savage poison.  He sits hunched over his brief case, picking up  pieces of his old job, cutting and pasting together a new one.  He is  drenched in the light from a desk lamp.  I watch him with my one eye closed  and the one against the pillow open.  He moves nervously.  I see him tremble  and perspire in the heat of the evening, thinking perhaps of Guadalupe and  her essence of citrus forenoon's.  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Sydney?" I ask rolling back the covers so that I can see him better.  The  bed screams as I turn onto my side.  At first he gives no clue that he can  hear me.  Then he says, "go to sleep Nina.  Just sleep, honey."  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Even though the night stands still in Playa del Carmen, I feel something  cold roll over my body, leaving black goose bumps across my flesh.  I close  my eyes to him, letting my dreams fill me like an empty cup, then spill me  over New York.  I am home again.</p><p class='section_break'>*</p><p>She just wants to go home...   </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I hear Sydney on the phone, most likely talking to his sister.  He is  whispering and I hear the tones of sympathy more then his exact words.  I  slip closer to the doorway, straining to hear.  A pillow of smoke comes from  the open doorway, greeting me and delivering my husbands whispered words on  pale vapors. "I let her down.  I lost my job.  Nina just hates it here.  But I love it."   Sydney is quiet for a moment.  I think about walking away, but don't.  "She  is lonely here in Mexico.  That's why she tried to...you know.  Suicide.   She thinks only of home.  She says, 'New York this, and Manhattan that'.  I  say, 'Nina, we can't afford it.  My job is here now, you know'.  Yeah.   Nostalgia.  She thinks only of the past."  </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I look at the bandages that badly contrast against my African skin.  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Suicide.  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Nostalgia.</p><p class='section_break'>*</p><p>When I awake my day is filled with Guadalupe.  She rides my hours, slipping  through door frames, mending Armani pants (because we can't afford new ones)  pressing handkerchiefs (the ones that I cry into).  She folds my underwear  into origami flowers, placing them into a cedar drawer like silk and nylon  bouquets.  I unfold them, each one, inhaling the perfume of her wrists,  which touch my garments and leave them with the fragrance of orchids.  I  hate her, I decide.  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        For dinner Guadalupe made Pico de Gallo, fresh tortillas and chili con  carne.  She let her hair down completely, draping over her thin shoulders,  all the way down to the red tie on her apron.  Sydney watches her rear end,  swaying from one hot pan to the other, the carmine fringe on her skirt  curving around her legs.  Her bare toes spread against the linoleum.  Sydney  is tracing over her body with his eyes like she is a maze.  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Won't you stay with us for dinner, Guadalupe?"  Sydney asks.  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        She shakes her head.  "Mi padre.  He is waiting for me."  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Sydney watches her without break.  "I insist, please.  Join us."  Guadalupe  sat in my chair.  The one I always use.  Sydney tosses me a glance.  I don't  say a word.  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Guadalupe ate the red chili peppers raw.  She pushed the piquant food  between her scarlet lips, chewing without hesitation.  She stared at me.   She unstrung me and made me hateful.  She looked over my skin, dark and  thick, tired and temporarily wrinkled in the corners.  She let her eyes  cascading over my short braids, and finally focusing on my bandages.  I put  my hands under the table.  </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Please excuse me," I said, leaving the kitchen.  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Back in my room I tried to dream of New York, but the laughter from the dining room kept me thinking of Guadalupe.</p><p class='section_break'>*</p><p>When Sydney left Mexico on a plane heading towards a possible business  venture in California, he had more to say to Ms. Chavez than to me.  She had  shaven his head only the night before, and he was looking more handsome than  I had remembered him to be, dressed in a black Dior suit.  I could see the  vague stitches Guadalupe had made in the pant hems.  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I watched him as he stood outside beneath the fig tree, looking through his  briefcase for the list he had prepared for her. Shadows moved across  Sydney's lips as he read off the instructions.  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "You know that gray suit upstairs?  There is a hole in the jacket.  I left  dinero on the counter for shopping.  Don't let Nina buy more cigarettes.  We  have no money for habits.  Also, enjoy yourself, Guadalupe.  The pool is  cool when the day is not."  Sydney smiled at her and tugged on the end of  her yellow shawl.  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I closed the window I had been watching them from.  I sat on the bed,  waiting for Sydney to come upstairs.  Waiting for him to tell me goodbye in  his own way; a dry kiss against my ashy cheek.  Perhaps he would offer me  some pesos along with an invitation to 'do something nice'.  I always  expected him to say, "please dear, don't try to take your own life again."  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        When he finally came upstairs the lock on his briefcase had already been  set and he was ready to go.  "Kisses," he commanded, offering me his pursed  mouth.  "Keep those bandages on at least until I get home.  Be nice to  Guadalupe.  She is here to help."   </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p><p class='section_break'>*</p>Guadalupe moved through our house like fish through the Gulf of Mexico.   Sleek in her manner, effortless in her ways, her sweat glistened skin caught  breezes from the open windows that she cleaned.  She would finish her chores  with such impeccability that I could not find reasons to complain.  Then,  when she stuck the chore list against the refrigerator with the red word  'done' printed on it she would turn up the music and dance.  Lord would she  dance.  She would tie up her long, black cotton dress, knot it in the front  and shake her hips like she was mixing a margarita and grenadine.  Her arms  would spread and fold, extend and pull.  Her fingers would close over her  face in dramatic postures.  All the while her perfume would intoxicate my  senses, her skirt fringe would fan the essence of tropical flowers into the  air, leaving me too dizzy to feel the rhythm.</p><p class='section_break'>*</p><p>Many of the nights I spent without Sydney were scented with white sand and  chipping paint and especially of heat.  A wind rolled through our bedroom,  carrying sounds of street brawls and fiestas.  Music would come rising from  between the walls, up through the tortilla thin ceilings, and into my  bedroom where I would awaken to a guitar and a woman singing, "Escuchadme"  and "Ya lo Creo!"  I laid in bed for half an hour, listening to the maracas  and the trumpets.  It was Guadalupe.  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I envied her fiesta of one.  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I chain smoked in bed, puffing away on hand rolled cigarettes.  Those were  all I had, besides my piquant rancor, cheap tobacco and early evenings  filled with the rumba and the cha-cha.</p><p class='section_break'>*</p><p>Without Sydney, I wanted to stay in bed all day.  Sometimes the only reason  I would roll out of bed and put on clothes was to watch Guadalupe.  She  would be dancing in the living room, and I would settle into my chair and  stare at her.  </p></div>

			<div class="pagers" id="6"><a href="SuicNost.shtml.html#5"><b>&lt;</b></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="SuicNost.shtml.html#6">6</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="SuicNost.shtml.html#7"><b>&gt;</b></a></div>
			
			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Would you like to dance?"  Guadalupe asked me one afternoon.  I had  finished my last cigarette the day before.  I sat before her merely a shadow  with cravings.  I wanted to spat at her as she offered me her palms upwards,  poised before me with one bare foot in front of the other.  She had just  finished dancing a merengue and a drop of perspiration held on to her tan  brow.  I shook my head, my slovenly braids scratching at the back of my  neck.  I felt so nappy, too hot, excessively fatigued.  I simply wanted  another cigarette, but Guadalupe had spent our last few pesos on flour and  oil.  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "No," I said, turning my face away from her.  "I'm not good at it," I  sniffed. Guadalupe reached up and looped her hair around her arm, tying it against  her scalp.  Again she reached out for me.  "Come now.  You have two  feet...you can dance.  I see you watch.  You like it.  Come dance.  I'll  show you."  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I looked at my bandages, slightly soiled with red dirt and cigarette ash  and water stains.  Though her perfume swathed around my mind, and the music  began...the drums clapping for an encore of her motion.  She lifted me by my  hand, placing my right hand down at waist level and my left on the round of  her hip.  She became a beacon to my feet, telling me to follow hers.  She  dipped me back, spun me to the side, then let go of my hand and separated  our bodies in climactic stances.  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "Shake, shake, shake!"  She yells, reclining her head in laughter, showing  me her fingers stretched apart, waving them and gripping them within a fist,  wrapping her entire arm around her torso and then wiggling free of it.  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        We danced like that, reckless in the heat of the late afternoon until the  music and her aroma of wilting bouquets set me apart from the uniform dolor.    Until the maraca's replaced the sound of whispers.  </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Suicide.  Nostalgia.  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Cha-cha-cha.</p><p class='section_break'>*</p><p>After dancing, Guadalupe and I laid nude underneath the heat of three  O'clock.  We were victims of fatigue caused by "viento fuego," or fire wind  from the edge of Playa del Carmen. Her body made curves along the grass, like brown sand dunes, smooth and  caramelized, glistening like the carbonation in our root beer mugs.  I  looked down at my black toes, let them wriggle, and then, completely  exhausted, I plopped my head against the grass.  We laughed simultaneously.  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Guadalupe rolled onto her side.  She looked at me for a few moments before  she said, "I think that before we danced you hated me."  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I couldn't look at her now.  My eyes focused on two clouds, one like a  feather, the other almost resembling the shape of New York.  "No.  I like  you," I said.  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        She sat up, pulled her knees into her chest.  Guadalupe adjusted her head  to watch the clouds as well.  She hesitated before saying, "You think your  esposo cares for me."  She looked at me, cautious of my reaction.  I was  placid, too tired to be angry.  Especially when she let her eyes soften  against me and she looked at me like just maybe she thought I was beautiful.  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "He does.  He loves you, Guadalupe.  You are everything that I used to  be...more even."  I pulled up a chunk of grass and let each blade fall  through my fist.  "Can you blame him?  You are ravishing."  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        She shook her head.  "You are beautiful.  He loves you."  She held up her  hair atop her head to let the wind lick and dry her neck.  "Men.  They see  what is red; they see what moves and what dances.  They do not see what  sours in corners.  You love him.  So dance!  Be red!"  </p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I let myself laugh a little.  I had though all this time that she hadn't  noticed me slinking through shadows and glaring from corners, the rings of  smoke my only physical contact to the outside world.  The world that laughed  and danced salsa around me. I shrugged my shoulders.  "I own no red.  I am from a place where being seen  in gray means you're taking a chance.  I like black suits, my brown Trianii  heels."  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Guadalupe smiles.  "Now you're in a place where wearing gray means you  drowned in a cenote.  Come."  She lifted herself from the ground, shedding  stray pieces of grass that clung to her skin.  "We'll make you a dress.  Un  vestido rojo."</p><p class='section_break'>*</p><p>In the attic of her house Guadalupe found four yards of ruby colored  cotton, a yard and a quarter of red silk, and lots and lots of black  gossamer.  She put some music on and danced around me with her hands full of  needles and spools of thread.  Pinking shears and measuring tape.  "Stand  still," she begged.  I could hardly keep my hips from rising beneath the  yards of red fabric encompassing my dark, lean frame.  "My fingers will be  more red than your dress if you don't hold still!"  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        We laughed while she fed me quesadillas because I couldn't move my arms.   By midnight she was finished, and I felt the snap as she pulled the last  thread.  She let the string fall to the floor.  "Esta rojo," she said,  presenting me to a mirror. I looked at my reflection.  I was a flame, an ocean of scarlet waves.  My  wrists were still wrapped, but now they were buried within the thick pleats.    I was the pistil encircled within red, silken petals.  Now I was the  flower. I realized suddenly that I had been holding my breath.  I let it out with a  giggle.  "I love it, Guadalupe," I said.  Then I realized that her name did  sound like a prayer.</p></div>

			<div class="story_text"><p><p class='section_break'>*</p>When Sydney came home late the following Sunday I didn't even notice him  standing in the doorway with his mouth agape, and his face twisted in a  combination of persuasion and curiosity.  "What's going on?" he asked.  But  the music did not stop at the command of his voice.  I turned my chin over  my shoulder, shaking my red rump at him...a Spanish greeting.  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        I began shimmying down in that red dress until it rode down the slope of  my bosom.  Guadalupe took my hand and lead me around her.  Beneath the music  she asked, "Nina, don't you think he sees you now?"  I moved closer to her,  wrapping her round with my arm.  "Go to him," she tells me.  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        "I will go to him when I am through with you," I said as we began to  perform her version of the paso doble.  Sydney watched from the door, his  eyes glued to me.  Smiling.  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Suddenly I realized the music was so loud that the whispers had begun to  fade.  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Suicide?  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Nostalgia?  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Nah.  </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;        Cha-cha-cha!</div>
